<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fauxdc">I</span>ohn</span> the yoongest son of Henrie the second was proclaimed king of England, beginning
his reigne the sixt daie of Aprill, in the yeare of our Lord 1199, the first of
Philip emperour of Rome, and the 20 of Philip king of France, K. William as yet liuing
in gouernement ouer the Scots. This man so soone as his brother Richard was deceased,
sent Hubert archbishop of Canturburie, and William Marshall earle of Striguill
(otherwise called Chepstow) into England, both to proclaime him king, and also to s&eacute;e
his peace kept, togither with Geffrey Fitz Peter lord ch&eacute;efe justice, and diuerse other
barons of the realme, whilest he himselfe went to Chinon where his brothers treasure laie,
which was foorthwith deliuered vnto him by Robert de Turneham: and therewith all the
castel of Chinon and Sawmer and diuerse other places, which were in the custodie of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
foresaid Robert. But Thomas de Furnes nephue to the said Robert de Turneham deliuered
the citie and castell of Angiers vnto Arthur duke of Britaine. For by generall
consent of the nobles and p&eacute;eres of the countries of Aniou, Maine, and Touraine, Arthur
was receiued as the liege and souereigne lord of the same countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strife amongst
the English
subiects on the
other side of
the sea.</div>

<p>For euen at this present, and so soone as it was knowne that king Richard was deceased,
diuerse cities and townes on that side of the sea belonging to the said Richard whilest he
liued, fell at ods among themselues, some of them indeuouring to preferre king John,
other labouring rather to be vnder the gouernance of Arthur duke of Britaine, considering
that he s&eacute;emed by most right to be their ch&eacute;efe lord, forsomuch as he was sonne to Geffrey
elder brother to John. And thus began the broile in those quarters, whereof in
processe of time insued great inconuenience, and finallie the death of the said Arthur, as
shall be shewed hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i>
The states
assembled at
Northampton.</div>

<p>Now whilest king John was thus occupied in recouering his brothers treasure, and
traueling with his subiects to reduce them to his obedience, qu&eacute;ene Elianor his mother by
the helpe of Hubert archbishop of Canturburie and other of the noble men and barons
of the land, trauelled as diligentlie to procure the English people to receiue their oth of
allegiance to be true to king John. For the said archbishop and William Marshall earle
of Striguill, being sent ouer into England (as before you haue heard) to proclaime him
king, and to k&eacute;epe the land in quiet, assembled the estates of the realme at Northampton,
where Geffrey Fitz Peter lord ch&eacute;efe iustice was present with other of the Nobles, afore
whom those lords whose fidelities were earst suspected, willinglie tooke their oths of obedience
to the new king, and were assured by the same lords on his behalfe, that they
should find him a liberall, a noble and a righteous prince, and such a one as would s&eacute;e
that euerie man should inioy his owne, and such as were knowne to be notorious transgressors,
should be sure to receiue their condigne punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eustace Vescie
sent into Scotland.</div>

<p>They sent Eustace de Vescie also vnto William king of Scotland, to signifie to him,
that king John vpon his arriuall in England, would satisfie him of all such right as he
pretended to haue within the English dominions. And thus was king John accompted
and proclaimed king of England by the generall consent of all the lords and barons of the
same. The names of the ch&eacute;efe of those p&eacute;eres that were sworne (as you haue heard)
are as followeth. Dauid earle of Huntington brother vnto William king of Scots, Richard
earle of Clare, Ranulfe earle of Chester, William earle of Tutberie or rather Darbie,
Walran earle of Warwike, Roger Lacie constable of Chester, and William de Mowbraie,
with diuerse other, whose names I here omit, bicause I would not be tedious and irksome
to the readers.</p>

<p>Now the king of Scotland being informed by the lord Eustace Vescie (who had maried
his daughter) that there was some hope to be had on his part, for the recouerie of such
seigniories as he and his predecessours somtime held in England, did further dispatch
sundrie ambassadours with full purpose to send them ouer into Normandie vnto king
John, there to require restitution of the countries of Northumberland and Cumberland,
with their appurtenances, and he promised also by his letters, that if the same might be
granted vnto him, in as ample manner as they had b&eacute;ene in times past to his ancestors,
he would gladlie doo his homage to king John, as to the true &amp; lawfull king of England for
the same, and furthermore y&eacute;eld to him his faithfull seruice against all men, so often as
he should be required thervnto. Howbeit when the archbishop of Canturburie and the
rest of the councell, vnderstood that these ambassadors should passe through England,
they would not suffer them so to doo, but sp&eacute;edilie sent Dauid earle of Huntington into
Scotland vnto the king his brother, requiring him earnestlie that he would not send any
ambassadours ouer as yet, but rather tarie, and take patience a while, till the king should
come ouer into England: which (as they said) he purposed to doo verie shortlie.</p>

<p>King John also hauing vnderstanding of his purpose, sent ouer the said lord Eustace
againe vnto him with the like request, who in such wise persuaded him, that he was con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>tented
to abide a time, in hope of the better successe in his late attempted suit. And all
this was doone ch&eacute;eflie by the working of the kings mother, whom the nobilitie much
honoured and loued. For she being bent to prefer hir sonne John, left no stone vnturned
to establish him in the throne, comparing oftentimes the difference of gouernement betw&eacute;ene
a king that is a man, and a king that is but a child. For as John was 32 yeares
old, so Arthur duke of Britaine was but a babe to speake of. In the end, winning all
the nobilitie wholie vnto hir will, and s&eacute;eing the coast to be cleare on euerie side, without
any doubt of tempestuous weather likelie to arise, she signified the whole matter vnto
K. John, who foorthwith framed all his indeuours to the accomplishment of his businesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Qu&eacute;ene Elianors

<div class="sidenote">Constance

<p>Surelie qu&eacute;ene Elianor the kings mother was sore against hir nephue Arthur, rather
mooued thereto by enuie conceiued against his mother, than vpon any iust occasion giuen
in the behalfe of the child, for that she saw if he were king, how his mother Constance
would looke to beare most rule within the realme of England, till hir sonne should come
to lawfull age, to gouerne of himselfe. &para; So hard it is to bring women to agr&eacute;e in one
mind, their natures commonlie being so contrarie, their words so variable, and their d&eacute;eds
so vndiscr&eacute;et. And therfore it was well said of one (alluding to their disposition and
qualities,</p>

<p>When this dooing of the qu&eacute;ene was signified vnto the said Constance, she doubting
the suertie of hir sonne, committed him to the trust of the French king, who receiuing
him into his tuition, promised to defend him from all his enimies, and foorthwith furnished
the holds in Britaine with French souldiers. Qu&eacute;ene Elianor being aduertised hereof,
stood in doubt by and by of hir countrie of Guien, and therefore with all possible sp&eacute;ed
passed ouer the sea, and came to hir sonne John into Normandie, and shortlie after they
went foorth togither into the countrie of Maine, and there tooke both the citie and castell
of Mauns, throwing downe the wals and turrets therof, with all the fortifications and stonehouses
in and about the same, and kept the citizens as prisoners, bicause they had aided
Arthur against his vncle John.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. John inuested
duke of
Normandie.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The citie of
Angiers taken.</div>

<p>After this, king John entring into Aniou, held his Easter at Beaufort (which feast fell
that yeare the 18 day of Aprill) and from thence he went streight vnto Rouen, where on
the sundaie next after Easter being S. Marks day, he was girded with the sword of the
dutchie of Normandie in the high church there by the hands of Walter archbishop of
Rouen. And so being inuested duke of Normandie, receiued the oth according to the
custome, that he should defend the church, and mainteine the liberties thereof, s&eacute;e iustice
ministred, good lawes put in execution, and naughtie lawes and orders abolished. In the
meane time his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor, togither with capteine Marchades entred into
Aniou, and wasted the same, bicause they of that countrie had receiued Arthur for their
souereigne lord and gouernour. And amongst other townes and fortresses, they tooke
the citie of Angiers, slue manie of the citizens, and committed the rest to prison.</p>

<p>This enterprise being thus luckilie atchiued, the residue of the people in those parties
were put in such feare, that of their owne accord they turned to their woonted obedience,
s&eacute;eming as though they would continue still therein. The French king all this while conceiuing
an other exploit in his head, more commodious vnto him than as yet to attempt
warre against the Englishmen vpon so light an occasion, dissembled the matter for a time,
as though he would know nothing of all that was doone, till the king should be otherwise
occupied in England about his coronation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. John commeth

<p>In the meane season king John hauing set some stay in his businesse on the further
side of the sea, he left his mother still in Guien, to defend that countrie against the
enimies, and taking the sea, came ouer himselfe into England, landing at Shorham, the
25 day of Maie. On the next day, being Ascension &eacute;eue, he came to London there to
receiue the crowne. On the morow after being Ascension daie, when the Nobilitie and
commons were assembled, and the king brought into the church of S. Peter at Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
there to receiue his diademe; Hubert the archbishop of Canturburie being ch&eacute;efe in
authoritie and honour, both for his age and calling, spake these words or the like in
substance before the whole assemblie, as followeth.</p>


<h2>Hubert the archbishop of Canturburies oration to the lords
spirituall and temporall in the presence of the king, &amp;c.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="fauxdc">M</span>ost</span> honorable lords of the spiritualtie, and most graue and politike p&eacute;eres and
barons of the temporaltie, you are come hither this day to choose you a king, and
such a one as (if n&eacute;ed should require) may be able of himselfe to take such a charge vpon
him, and (hauing vndertaken the same) readie to execute that which he shall thinke to
be expedient for the profit of his subiects: we haue therefore one present h&eacute;ere among
vs, vpon whome harts and good willes of high and low, rich and poore, doo generallie
depend: a man I doubt not, but that for his owne part will applie his whole endeuour,
studie, and thought vnto that onelie end, which he shall perceiue to be most profitable
for the common-wealth, as knowing himselfe to be borne not to serue his owne turne, but
for to profit his countrie, and to s&eacute;eke for the generall benefit of vs that are his subiects.</p>

<p>And albeit I am sure that you doo well know, how all these qualities are most abundantlie
planted in the person of John duke of Normandie (a person of high prowesse and
no lesse prudence, for the which y&eacute;e ought to iudge him right worthie of the gouernement)
yet b&eacute;eing in doubt least the common fame should carrie you awaie, or least you should
turne your minds to the fauour of an other, as in respect of some better right, by title of
a more lawfull descent of inheritance pretended by others than he hath to shew, I require
you to giue eare vnto my words: who bearing the state of two manner of persons, ought
to be profitable to my countrie, not onelie by example and exhortation, but also by
loialtie and good counsell, which hitherto I haue euer studied to performe, and wherein
(God willing) I meane to persist, so long as I shall continue in this mortall and transitorie
tabernacle.</p>

<p>Therefore whereas at this present we haue in hand to conclude vpon such a weitie
matter, which b&eacute;eing once doone, cannot be vndoone, I commend vnto you this John,
euen with all my verie heart, and iudge that you ought to accept him for your king, who
in all things which he shall ordeine, purpose, or take in hand, shall not faile so to
answer your opinions with his well dooing, and so satisfie your good expectations
alreadie conceiued of him with his diligent prouidence, that all the whole realme shall
not onelie like of and allow your dooing h&eacute;erin, but also with high commendation extoll
the same to the verie stars. These things do I promise vnto you, and so farforth as in
me may lie, I dare take vpon me all chances and perils that may proc&eacute;ed thereof.</p>

<p>When the archbishop had ended his speach, diuerse held their peace, and manie with
great zeale saluted king John, whom the same daie the said archbishop crowned at Westminster,
after the maner then vsed with great solemnitie, and no lesse reioising of all such
as were present. At the same time also he receiued the homages of the lords and barons
of the realme, and promised with all sp&eacute;ed to haue consideration of things that apperteined
as well to religion as to the due execution of laws, whereby euerie man might come
to inioie that which was his owne, by right and due course of iustice. We find that there
were present at this solemnitie and coronation of king John, which was celebrated on the
Ascension day the 27 of Maie, archbishops and bishops to the number of seauent&eacute;ene,

<div class="sidenote">Ambassadors from the king of Scots.</div>

<p>the lord Hugh Bardolfe said vnto him, yet not so softlie in his eare, but that some ouerheard
it; "My lord, to speake and not offend you, suerlie if you would well consider
the dignitie and honor of your calling, you would not willinglie y&eacute;eld to suffer this yoke
of bondage to be laid vpon your shoulders, for we haue oftentimes heard of a chancellour
made an archbishop, but neuer an archbishop made a chancellour till now." The coronation
being thus ended, it was not long yer there came ambassadors from the Scotish
king, namelie William the prior of May, William the prior of saint Colmes Ins, and one
William Hay, the which on the behalfe of the said Scotish king required restitution of
Northumberland and Cumberland, with the appurtenances, promising that if the same
were restored to him, he would serue the king of England with all his power against all
men then aliue; otherwise, that is, if he could not haue those countries, which of right to
him apperteined by law, as he pretended, he would doo the best he could to recouer them
by force.</p>

<p>King John made answer h&eacute;erevnto, that if his coosen the king of Scots would come
vnto him, he should be assured to receiue at his hands all that was reason, as well in
those demands, as in all other things. He also sent to him the bishop of Duresme, to
require him to come vnto Notingham, where he would m&eacute;et with him. Howbeit, king
William refused to come himselfe as then, but sent the bishop of saint Andrew, and Hugh
Malebisse to follow his suit, with promise to absteine from any forceable inuasion of England,
by the space of fortie daies, so that he might within that terme haue some resolute
answer from king John, wherevnto he might stand either on the one side or the other.</p>

that countrie latelie before through feare alienated. In an other part, an armie of

the victorie, tooke the citie of Angiers, which king John had woon from duke
Arthur, in the last yeare passed. These things being signified to king John he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
to make prouision for the recouerie of his losses there, with all sp&eacute;ed possible. And
therevpon perceiuing that the Scotish king meant not to m&eacute;et with him at Notingham

riding to and fro betwixt the two kings, they came to a communication, and
tooke truce for fiftie daies. The earle of Flanders being certified thereof, was sorie in his
hart, and loth that the French king should come to any accord with the king of England,
and therefore to turne the mind of king John from the purpose of peace, he came to visit
him at Rouen, where they renewed the league betwixt England &amp; Flanders, to be the
better able to defend themselues from the French power: and withall determined fullie,
that immediatlie vpon the expiring of this last truce they would make the French king

French king was glad to restore the elect of Cambrey to his libertie. And likewise king

before the time that the truce should expire; to wit, on the morrow after the feast of the

in a place betwixt the townes of Buteuant and Guleton. Within thr&eacute;e daies
after, they came togither personallie, and communed at full of the variance depending

<p>But these, &amp; diuerse other requests which he made, king John would not in any wise

earls and barons of France, which before that time had serued king Richard, repaired
vnto king John, and tooke an oth to assist him, and not to agr&eacute;e with the French king
without his consent: and he likewise sware vnto them, not to make peace with the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>

sister, wife to Raimond earle of S. Giles, and somtime qu&eacute;ene of Sicile, died at Rouen,
and was buried at Fonteuerard. The French king also tooke diuerse townes and castels,
but amongst other the castell of Balun, and raced the wals thereof downe to the ground,
wherewith William de Roches, generall of the armie of Arthur duke of Britaine, was
greatlie offended, and did so much by his drift, that shortlie after a peace was concluded
betwixt king John and his nephue duke Arthur, though the same serued but to small

<p>The French king hauing (as I haue said) ouerthrowne the wals of Balun, besieged a
fortresse called Lauardin, but king John comming with an armie, caused him to raise his
siege, and to withdraw himselfe to the citie of Mauns, whither he followed, and compelled
him (mauger his force) to remooue from thence. All this while was William de Roches
busilie occupied about his practise, to make king John and his nephue Arthur fr&eacute;ends,
which thing at length he brought about, and therevpon deliuered into king Johns hands
the citie of Mauns which he had in k&eacute;eping. Also the vicount of Tours came to the king
of England and surrendred vnto him the castell of Chinon, the k&eacute;eping whereof he betooke
vnto Roger de Lacie the conestable of Chester. But in the night folowing, vpon
some mistrust and suspicion gathered in the obseruation of the couenants on K. Johns
behalfe, both the said Arthur, with his mother Constance, the said vicount of Tours, and
diuerse other, fled awaie secretlie from the king, and got them to the citie of Angiers,
where the mother of the said Arthur refusing hir former husband the earle of Chester,
married hir selfe to the lord Guie de Tours, brother to the said vicount, by the popes
dispensation. The same yere, Philip bastard sonne to king Richard, to whome his father

time of the towne of Barwike, who by the Scotish kings commandement would haue
repared againe the same bridge, which could not be doone, but that the one end thereof
must be builded on the bishop of Durhams ground, which he would not suffer, till by the
counsell of the lord William de Stuteuille, he agr&eacute;ed, so that the conuention accorded
and concluded betwixt the king of Scots and his predecessour bishop Hugh might be
reserued inuiolable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A rate of y<sup>e</sup>

<p>Furthermore, king John did set a rate vpon the prices of wines, as Rochell wine to be

shillings the tun, and no other French wines aboue fiue and twentie shillings the tun,
except it were of such notable goodnesse as that some peraduenture for their owne expenses
would be contented to giue after twentie six shillings eight pence for the tun, and
not aboue. Moreouer, the galon of Rochell wine he appointed to be sold at foure pence:
and the galon of white wine at six pence. It was also ordeined, that in euerie citie,
towne, and place where wine was vsed to be sold, there should be twelue honest men
sworne to haue regard that this assise should not be broken: and that if they found any
vintner that should from the pin sell any wine by small measures contrarie to the same
assise, his bodie should be attached by the shiriffe, and deteined in prison, till other commandement
were giuen for his further punishment, and his goods seized vnto the kings vse.
Furthermore, if any persons were or should be found to buy and sell by the hogshead or
tun, contrarie to this assise, they should be committed to prison, there to remaine, till
other order were taken for them: neither should there be any regrating of wines that
were brought into England. But this ordinance lasted not long, for the merchants could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>

in hope to haue met the king of Scots there, but he came not, and so king John returned
backe, and sailed againe into Normandie, bicause the variance still depended betw&eacute;ene
him and the king of France. Finallie vpon the Ascension day in this second yeare of
his reigne, they came eftsoones to a communication betwixt the townes of Vernon and
Lisle Dandelie, where finallie they concluded an agr&eacute;ement, with a marriage to be had
betwixt Lewes the sonne of king Philip, and the ladie Blanch, daughter to Alfonso king
of Castile the 8 of that name, &amp; n&eacute;ece to K. John by his sister Elianor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ra. Niger.</i></div>

<p>In consideration whereof, king John, besides the summe of thirtie thousand markes in
siluer, as in respect of dowrie assigned to his said n&eacute;ece, resigned his title to the citie of
Eureux, and also vnto all those townes which the French king had by warre taken from
him, the citie of Angiers onelie excepted, which citie he receiued againe by couenants of
the same agr&eacute;ement. The French king restored also to king John (as Rafe Niger writeth)
the citie of Tours, and all the castels and fortresses which he had taken within Touraine:
and moreouer, receiued of king John his homage for all the lands, f&eacute;es and tenements
which at anie time his brother king Richard, or his father king Henrie had holden of him,
the said king Lewes or any his predecessors, the quit claims and marriages alwaies excepted.
The king of England likewise did homage vnto the French king for Britaine, and
againe (as after you shall heare) receiued homage for the same countrie, and for the
countie of Richmont of his nephue Arthur. He also gaue the earledome of Glocester
vnto the earle of Eureux, as it were by way of exchange, for that he resigned to the
French king all right, title &amp; claime that might be pretended to the countie of Eureux.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The king co&#772;meth backe againe into England.</div>

<p>By this conclusion of marriage betwixt the said Lewes and Blanch, the right of king
John went awaie, which he lawfullie before pretended vnto the citie of Eureux, and vnto
those townes in the confines of Berrie, Chateau, Roux or Raoul, Cressie and Isoldune,
and likewise vnto the countrie of Veuxin or Veulquessine, which is a part of the territorie
of Gisors: the right of all which lands, townes and countries was released to the king of
France by K. John, who supposed that by his affinitie, and resignation of his right to
those places, the peace now made would haue continued for euer. And in consideration
thereof, he procured furthermore, that the foresaid Blanch should be conueied into France
to hir husband with all sp&eacute;ed. That doone he returned into England.</p>

<p>&para; Certes this peace was displeasant to manie, but namelie to the earle of Flanders,
who herevpon making no accompt of king Johns amitie, concluded a peace with king
Philip shortlie after, and ment to make warre against the infidels in the east parts,
wherby we may s&eacute;e the discontented minds of men, and of how differing humors they be,
so that nothing is harder than to satisfie manie with one thing, be the same neuer so good,</p>

<p>But by the chronicles of Flanders it appeareth, that the earle of Flanders concluded a
peace with the French king in Februarie last past, before that king John and the French
king fell to any composition. But such was the malice of writers in times past, which
they bare towards king John, that whatsoeuer was doone in prejudice of him or his subiects,
it was still interpreted to chance through his default, so as the blame still was
imputed to him, in so much that although manie things he did peraduenture in matters of
gouernement: for the which he might be hardlie excused, yet to thinke that he deserued
the tenth part of the blame wherewith writers charge him, it might s&eacute;eme a great lacke
of aduised consideration in them that so should take it. But now to proc&eacute;ed with our

which alienated the minds of a great number of them from his loue and obedience. At
length also, when he had got togither a great masse of monie, he went ouer againe into
Normandie, where by Helias archbishop of Burdeaux, and the bishop of Poictiers and
Scone, he was diuorsed from his wife Isabell, that was the daughter of Robert earle of

Secondlie, for that the same archbishop refused to go ouer with the king into Normandie
to helpe to make the marriage betwixt the French kings sonne and his n&eacute;ece. Thirdlie,
bicause he had excommunicated the same shiriffe and all the prouince of Yorke: wherevpon

which councell or synod, diuerse constitutions were made and ordeined for orders and
customes to be vsed touching the seruice and administration of sacraments in the church,
and other articles concerning churchmen and ecclesiasticall matters. About the same
time, king John and Philip king of France met togither n&eacute;ere the towne of Vernon,
where Arthur duke of Britaine (as vassall to his vncle king John) did his homage vnto
him for the duchie of Britaine, &amp; those other places which he held of him on this side and
beyond the riuer of Loir, and afterward still mistrusting his vncles curtesie, he returned
backe againe with the French king, and would not commit himselfe to his said vncle, who
(as he supposed) did beare him little good will. These things being thus performed, king
John returned into England, and there caused his new married wife Isabell to be crowned
on the sundaie before the feast of S. Denise, the eight of October.</p>

<p>At the same time he gaue commandement vnto Hugh Neuill high iustice of his forrests,

of his forrests all their horsses of Haraz, and other cattell, vnder the penaltie to forfeit so
manie of them, as after that day chanced to be found within the same forrests. The
cause that mooued the king to deale so hardlie with them was, for that they refused to
helpe him with monie, when before his last going ouer into Normandie, he demanded it
of them towards the paiment of the thirtie thousand pounds which he had couenanted to
pay the French king, to liue in rest and peace, which he coueted to haue done for reliefe

the number of thirt&eacute;ene, as Duresme, London, Rochester, Elie, Bath, Salisburie, Winchester,
Hereford, Norwich, S. Andrews in Scotland, Landaffe, and Bangor in Wales, and
Meth in Ireland, beside a great multitude of earles, barons, and other Noblemen. When
the king of Scots had thus doone his homage, he required restitution of Northumberland,
Cumberland and Westmerland, which he claimed as his right and lawfull heritage.
Much talke was had touching this matter, but they could not agr&eacute;e, and therefore king
John asked respit to consider of it till the feast of Pentecost next insuing, which being
granted, the king of Scots the next morrow being the 23 of Nouember returned homewards,
and was conducted backe againe into his countrie by the same Noble men that
brought him to Lincolne.</p>

<p>The same day that the king of Scots tooke his iournie homewards from Lincolne, the
corps of Hugh bishop of that citie (latelie before, departed this life at London, after his
returne from the parts of beyond the seas) was brought thither to be buried, the king
and all the bishops, earles and barons went to receiue it, and honoured his buriall with
their presence. On the morrow after being fridaie, he was interred within the new church
which he had builded. This Hugh was a Frenchman by nation, borne at Granople, a
man of a pregnant wit, and skilfull both in science of holie scripture and humane knowledge.
He was first a regular canon, and after became a Carthusian moonke. King
Henrie the second mooued with the fame of his vertue and godlie life, sent the bishop of
Bath to bring him into England, and after he was come, made him first abbat of Whithing
in the diocesse of Welles, and after created him bishop of Lincolne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A presumptuous
part in a
bishop.</div>

<p>He was noted to be of a verie perfect life, namelie, bicause he would not sticke to reprooue
men of their faults plainelie and frankelie, not regarding the fauour or disfauour
of any man, in somuch that he would not feare to pronounce them accurssed, which being
the kings officers, would take vpon them the punishment of any person within orders of
the church, for hunting and killing of the kings game within his parkes, forrests and
chases, yea (and that which is more) he would denie paiments of such subsidies and taxes
he was assessed to paie to the vses of king Richard and king John, towards the maintenance
of their wars, and did oftentimes accursse by his ecclesiasticall authoritie, such
shiriffes, collectors, or other officers, as did distreine vpon his lands and goods for to
satisfie these kings of their demands, alledging openlie, that he would not paie any monie
towards the maintenance of wars, which one Christian prince, vpon priuate displeasure and
grudge, made against another prince of the same religion. This was his reason.</p>

<p>And when he came before the king to make answer to his disobedience shewed herein,
he would so handle the matter, partlie with gentle admonishments, partlie with sharpe
reproofes, and sometime mixing merrie and pleasant sp&eacute;ech amongst his serious arguments,
that often times he would so qualifie the kings mood, that being driuen from
anger, he could not but laugh and smile at the bishops pleasant talke and merrie conceits,
so that it might well be said of him,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit vtile dulci.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This maner he vsed, not onelie with the king alone, but with the father and the two
sonnes, that is to say, Henrie the second, Richard and John, in whose time he ruled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
gouerned the s&eacute;e of Lincolne. He was after his decesse, for the opinion which men conceiued
of his holinesse and vertues, admitted into the number of the saints.</p>

<p>Y&eacute;e haue heard how king John had conceiued no small displeasure against the moonks
of the white order, for that they would not part with any monie, excusing themselues that
they might not doo it, without consent of a generall chapiter of their order. Wherevpon
the king had caused them diuerse waies to be molested, but ch&eacute;efelie in restreining them
of libertie to haue any horsses or other cattell going to pasture within his forrests. They
therefore taking aduise togither, chose foorth twelue abbats amongst them of that order,
the which in all their names went to Lincolne, there to make suit to the king (comming
thither at this time to m&eacute;et the king of Scots) that it would please him to remit his displeasure
conceiued against them, and to take them againe into his protection.</p>

<p>This suit was so followed, although with some difficultie, that at length, to wit, the
sundaie after that the king of Scots had doone his homage, through the helpe and furtherance
of the archbishop of Canturburie, they came to the kings sp&eacute;ech, and obteined so
much, as they in reason might desire: for he pardoned them of all his passed displeasure,
receiued them againe into his fauour, tooke them into his protection, and commanded
that all iniuries, gr&eacute;euances and molestations should be reformed, redressed and amended,
which in respect of his indignation had b&eacute;ene offered and doone to them by any manner
of meanes. And to s&eacute;e the same accomplished, writs were directed vnto the shiriffes of
the counties, bearing date from Lincolne the 27 of Nouember. And thus were those
moonks for that time restored to the kings fauour, to their great commoditie and comfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fiue moones.</div>

<p>About the moneth of December, there were s&eacute;ene in the prouince of Yorke fiue

south, and the fift as it were set in the middest of the other, hauing manie stars about it,
and went fiue or six times incompassing the other, as it were the space of one houre, and
shortlie after vanished awaie. The winter after was extreamelie cold, more than the
naturall course had b&eacute;ene aforetime. And in the springtime came a great glutting and
continuall raine, causing the riuers to rise with higher flouds than they had b&eacute;ene accustomed.</p>

<p>In the yeare 1201 king John held his Christmas at Gilford, and there gaue to his seruants
manie faire liueries and suits of apparell. The archbishop of Canturburie did also
the like at Canturburie, s&eacute;eming in d&eacute;ed to striue with the king, which of them should
passe the other in such sumptuous appareling of their men: whereat the king (and not
without good cause) was greatlie mooued to indignation against him, although for a time
he coloured the same, going presentlie into the north, where he gathered of the countrie
there no small summs of monie, as it were by way of fining them for their transgressions
committed in his forrests.</p>

<p>From thence he returned and came to Canturburie, where he held his easter, which
fell that yeare on the day of the Annunciation of our ladie, in the which feast he sat
crowned, togither with his wife qu&eacute;ene Isabell, the archbishop of Canturburie bearing the
charges of them and their trains while they remained there. At the feast of the Ascension
next insuing, king John set out a proclamation at Tewkesburie, that all the earles
and barons of the realme, and also all other that held of him by knights seruice, should be
readie in the feast of Pentecost next insuing, with horsse and armour at Portesmouth, to
passe ouer with him into Normandie, who made their appearance accordinglie. Howbeit,
a great number of them in the end gat licence to tarrie at home, paieng for euerie
knights f&eacute;e two markes of siluer for a fine, which then was a great matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rog. Houed.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The archbish. of Yorke restored.</div>

<p>But he sent before him into Normandie William Marshall earle of Striguille with an

This doone, he pardoned his brother the archbishop of Yorke, and restored him to all his
dignities, possessions and liberties, confirming the same vnto him in as full and large
manner, as euer Roger late archbishop of that s&eacute;e had enioied the same: for the which
confirmation his said brother vndertooke to paie to the king within the terme of one yeare
the summe of a thousand pounds starling; and for the assurance thereof, engaged his

<p>Moreouer, about the same time, the king sent Geffrey bishop of Chester, and Richard

time appointed for him to make answer touching his demand of Northumberland, might
be proroged vntill the feast of saint Michaell the archangell next insuing, which was obteined,
and then the king and qu&eacute;ene (being come to Portsmouth on the mondaie in
Whitsunw&eacute;eke) tooke the sea to passe ouer into Normandie, but not both in one ship, so
that the qu&eacute;ene with a prosperous gale of wind arriued there at hir owne desire. But the
king was driuen by reason of a pirrie, to take land in the Ile of Wight, and so was staied
there for a time: howbeit, within a few daies after, he tooke ship againe at Portsmouth,
and so passed ouer into Normandie, where shortlie after his arriuall in those parties he
came to an enteruiew with the king of France, n&eacute;ere to Lisle Donelie, where comming
a long time togither alone, they agr&eacute;ed so well, that within thr&eacute;e daies after, king John at
the French kings request went into France, and was receiued of him with much honour,
first at S. Denise with procession of the cleargie: and there lodging one night, vpon the
morrow the French king accompanied him vnto Paris, where he was receiued of the
citizens with great reuerence, the prouost presenting vnto him in the name of the whole
citie manie rich gifts for his welcome. K. Philip feasted him also in his owne palace, &amp;
for his part gaue to him, to his lords, and to his seruants manie great and princelie gifts.
Morouer, the league at this time was renewed betwixt them, and put in writing, with
this caution, that whether of them first brake the couenants; such lords on his part as
were become suerties for performance, should be released of their allegiance which they
owght to him that so should breake, &amp; that they might therevpon fr&eacute;elie become subiects

tooke leaue of him in verie louing wise. After this king John went to Chinon, &amp; from
thence into Normandie; about which time there chanced some troubles in Ireland, for
where Walter Lacie vnder pretense of a communication that was appointed betwixt him
and John de Curcie, lord of Vlnester, meant to haue taken the said Curcie, and for the

constreined Curcie in the end to take a castell which belonged vnto Hugh Lacie, vpon
faire promises made to him by the same Hugh, to be preserued out of all danger, it came
to passe, that when he was once got in, he might no more be suffered to depart. For
the Lacies thought to haue deliuered him to king John, but the seruants and fr&eacute;ends of
the said Curcie made such cruell war, in wasting and destroieng the lands and possessions
that belonged vnto the said Walter and Hugh Lacies, that finallie they were constreined
to set him againe at libertie whether they would or no.</p>

tooke Buteuant, Augi, and the castell of Linos. Moreouer, he besieged the castell of
Radepont for the space of eight daies, till king John came thither, and forced him to
depart with much dishonor. Howbeit after this, the French king wan Gourney, and then
returning to Paris, he appointed certeine persons to haue the gouernement of the foresaid

vnderstand any thing of his comming, or gesse what the matter meant, when they saw
such a companie of souldiers as he brought with him to approch so n&eacute;ere the citie. For
so negligent were they, that hauing once woone the towne, they ranged abroad ouer the

<p>The French king at the same time lieng in siege before Arques, immediatlie vpon the
newes of this ouerthrow, raised from thence, and returned homewards, destroieng all that
came in his waie, till he was entred into his owne countrie. It is said that king John
caused his nephue Arthur to be brought before him at Falais, and there went about to persuade
him all that he could to forsake his fr&eacute;endship and aliance with the French king,
and to leane and sticke to him being his naturall vncle. But Arthur like one that wanted
good counsell, and abounding too much in his owne wilfull opinion, made a presumptuous
answer, not onelie denieng so to doo, but also commanding king John to restore vnto him
the realme of England, with all those other lands and possessions which king Richard had
in his hand at the houre of his death. For sith the same apperteined to him by right of
inheritance, he assured him, except restitution were made the sooner, he should not long
continue quiet. King John being sore mooued with such words thus vttered by his
nephue, appointed (as before is said) that he should be straitlie kept in prison, as first in
Falais, and after at Roan within the new castell there. Thus by meanes of this good

<p>Shortlie after king John comming ouer into England, caused himselfe to be crowned
againe at Canturburie by the hands of Hubert the archbishop there, on the fourt&eacute;enth day
of Aprill, and then went backe againe into Normandie, where immediatlie vpon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
arriuall, a rumour was spred through all France, of the death of his nephue Arthur.
True it is that great suit was made to haue Arthur set at libertie, as well by the French
king, as by William de Riches a valiant baron of Poictou, and diuerse other Noble men
of the Britains, who when they could not preuaile in their suit, they banded themselues
togither, and ioining in confederacie with Robert earle of Alanson, the vicount Beaumont,
William de Fulgiers, and other, they began to leuie sharpe wars against king John in
diuerse places, insomuch (as it was thought) that so long as Arthur liued, there would be
no quiet in those parts: wherevpon it was reported, that king John through persuasion of
his councellors, appointed certeine persons to go vnto Falais, where Arthur was kept in
prison, vnder the charge of Hubert de Burgh, and there to put out the yoong gentlemans
eies.</p>

<p>But through such resistance as he made against one of the tormentors that came to
execute the kings commandement (for the other rather forsooke their prince and countrie,
than they would consent to obeie the kings authoritie h&eacute;erein) and such lamentable words
as he vttered, Hubert de Burgh did preserue him from that iniurie, not doubting but
rather to haue thanks than displeasure at the kings hands, for deliuering him of such
infamie as would haue redounded vnto his highnesse, if the yoong gentleman had b&eacute;ene
so cruellie dealt withall. For he considered, that king John had resolued vpon this point
onelie in his heat and furie (which moueth men to vndertake manie an inconuenient enterprise,
vnbes&eacute;eming the person of a common man, much more reprochfull to a prince,
all men in that mood being m&eacute;ere foolish and furious, and prone to accomplish the peruerse
conceits of their ill possessed heart; as one saith right well,</p>

</div></div>

<p>and that afterwards, vpon better aduisement, he would both repent himselfe so to haue
commanded, and giue them small thanke that should s&eacute;e it put in execution. Howbeit
to satisfie his mind for the time, and to staie the rage of the Britains, he caused it to be
bruted abroad through the countrie, that the kings commandement was fulfilled, and that
Arthur also through sorrow and gr&eacute;efe was departed out of this life. For the space of
fift&eacute;ene daies this rumour incessantlie ran through both the realmes of England and France,
and there was ringing for him through townes and villages, as it had b&eacute;ene for his funerals.
It was also bruted, that his bodie was buried in the monasterie of saint Andrewes
of the Cisteaux order.</p>

<p>But when the Britains were nothing pacified, but rather kindled more vehementlie to
worke all the misch&eacute;efe they could deuise, in reuenge of their souereignes death, there was
no remedie but to signifie abroad againe, that Arthur was as yet liuing and in health.
Now when the king heard the truth of all this matter, he was nothing displeased for that
his commandement was not executed, sith there were diuerse of his capteins which vttered
in plaine words, that he should not find knights to k&eacute;epe his castels, if he dealt so cruellie
with his nephue. For if it chanced any of them to be taken by the king of France or other
their aduersaries, they should be sure to tast of the like cup. &para; But now touching the
maner in verie d&eacute;ed of the end of this Arthur, writers make sundrie reports. Neuerthelesse
certeine it is, that in the yeare next insuing, he was remooued from Falais vnto the
castell or tower of Rouen, out of the which there was not any that would confesse that

<div class="sidenote"><i>1204.</i></div>

<p>King John about the beginning of this sixt yeare of his reigne, sent in ambassage to
the French king the archbishop of Canturburie, the bishops of Norwich and Elie, the
earles Marshall and Leicester, to treat with him of peace: but he was so far off from
comming n&eacute;ere to any reasonable motions, bicause he saw the world frame as he wished,
that still by demanding somewhat that might not be granted, he kept off, and brought in
such hard conditions, that it was not possible to conclude anie agr&eacute;ement. And this he
did of purpose, hoping within short time to conquer all that the king of England possessed
as yet on that side the seas. He was the more vntoward to compound, for that he
was informed how Arthur the duke of Britaine was dispatched of his life, and therfore not
doubting but to haue manie to take part with him in s&eacute;eking reuenge of his death, he
made that his ch&eacute;efe quarell, swearing that he would not ceasse to pursue the warre
against king John, till he had depriued him of his whole kingdome. So the ambassadors
departed without all hope to come to any agr&eacute;ement. &para; This yeare Easter day fell
so high as it possiblie might, that is to saie, on saint Marks day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Towns wun

<p>King Philip vnderstanding that king John remained still in England, rather occupied
in gathering of monie amongst his subiects, than in making other prouision to bring them
into the field (to the great offense of his said people) thought now for his part to lose no
time: but assembling a mightie armie, he came with the same into Normandie, and vpon
his first comming, he wan the towne of Falaise, and shortlie after was Dampfront deliuered
vnto him by surrender. This doone, he marched further into the countrie, and with his
sudden inuasion so oppressed the people euerie where, that they could haue no time to
make shift by flight to get into the townes. With this swiftnesse of sp&eacute;ed, he brought also
such a feare into the hearts of most men, that he wan all the countrie of Normandie euen
to Mount S. Michaell. The inhabitants in euerie place submitted themselues, as those
of Baieulx, Constances, Liseux, and other townes thereabouts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rouen besieged

<p>Finallie, he came before Rouen, the principall citie of all the countrie, and incamped
so in sundrie places about the citie, that all the issues, entries and waies were closed vp
by his armie, being so diuided into seuerall camps, that the distance was not great from
one to another, making a terrible shew to them within. At length after he had prouided
all things necessarie for his purpose, and taken good aduise of his capteins how he should
best imploie his force for the winning of this citie (in which exploit he knew the full perfection
of all his passed conquests ch&eacute;efelie to consist) he did manfullie assault it, and
they within as manfullie defended themselues, so that he got little by the assaults and approches
which he made. Wherevpon he fell in hand to practise with the citizens to win
them with m&eacute;ed, curtesie, gentle sp&eacute;ech, and great promises. So that in fine, they within
were so mooued with such reasons as he vsed to persuade them withall, that they made
request for a truce to be had for certeine daies, within the terme whereof if no succour
came, they couenanted to y&eacute;eld without any further trouble.</p>

<p>This truce being obteined, ambassadours were sent from them of Rouen into England,

not within the time appointed, the citie must n&eacute;eds be deliuered into the enimies hands.
The king hauing no armie in readinesse to send ouer, nor other shift to make for the succour
of the citie, permitted the ambassadours to depart without comfort of any aid, who
herevpon returning to Rouen, and reporting what they had hard, s&eacute;ene, and found,
brought the citie into great sorrow. For whereas that citie had euer b&eacute;ene accustomed
to glorie for the great loialtie and faithfull fidelitie which the same had euer shewed towards
their liege lords and naturall princes; now the citizens perceiued manifestlie, that
vnlesse they would cast awaie themselues, and lose all they had, they must of force y&eacute;eld
into the hands of their enimies. Wherefore to make their true allegiance more apparant to
the world, they staied the surrender as long as they had any store of vittels within the
citie to rel&eacute;eue their fainting bodies withall: and so in the end being vanquished with
hunger, they submitted themselues to the French king. Their submission being once
knowne, caused all those other townes which had not y&eacute;elded, to deliuer vp their keies
vnto the Frenchmen, as Arques, Vernueill, and others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>Moreouer the townes in Poictou, Touraine, and Aniou, which king John had recouered
latelie before, did now againe (being in no small feare) y&eacute;eld themselues vnto
king Philip: so that of all the townes within those countries, there remained none vnder
the English obeisance, saue onelie Rochell, Tours, Niorth, and a few other. Thus Normandie
which king Rollo had purchased and gotten 316 yeares before that present time,
was then recouered by the French men, to the great reproch and dishonour of the English,
in this yeare 1204. About this time qu&eacute;ene Elianor the mother of king John departed
this life, consumed rather through sorow and anguish of mind, than of any other
naturall infirmitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fish like to a
man.</div>

<p>In this sixt yeare of king Johns reigne, at Oreford in Suffolke, as Fabian saith (although
I thinke he be deceiued in the time) a fish was taken by fishers in their nets as they
were at sea, resembling in shape a wild or sauage man, whome they presented vnto sir
Bartholomew de Glanuille knight, that had then the k&eacute;eping of the castell of Oreford in
Suffolke. He was naked, and in all his lims and members resembling the right proportion
of a man; he had haires also in the vsuall parts of his bodie, albeit that the crowne of his
head was bald, his beard was long and rugged, and his breast hairie. The knight caused
him to be kept certeine daies &amp; nights from the sea, meat set afore him he gr&eacute;edilie deuoured,
&amp; did eat fish both raw and sod. Those that were raw he pressed in his hand
till he had thrust out all the moisture, and so then did eat them. He would not or could
not vtter any speach, although to trie him they hung him vp by the h&eacute;eles, and miserablie
tormented him. He would get him to his couch at the setting of the sunne, and rise
againe at the rising of the same.</p>

<p>One day they brought him to the hauen, and suffered him to go into the sea, but to be
sure he should not escape from them, they set thr&eacute;e ranks of mightie strong nets before
him, so to catch him againe at their pleasure (as they imagined) but he streightwaies
diuing downe to the bottome of the water, got past all the nets, and comming vp, shewed
himselfe to them againe that stood waiting for him, and dowking diuerse times vnder water
and comming vp againe he beheld them on the shore that stood still looking at him,
who s&eacute;emed as it were to mocke them, for that he had deceiued them, &amp; got past their
nets. At length after he had thus sported himselfe a great while in the water, and that
there was no more hope of his returne, he came to them againe of his owne accord, swimming
through the water, and remained with them two moneths after. But finallie, when
he was negligentlie looked to, and now s&eacute;emed not to be regarded, he fled secretlie to the
sea, and was neuer after s&eacute;ene nor heard of.</p>

March, chiefe leaders of that faction. But Robert Turneham, togither with Sauerie de
Mauleon, and Gerard de Atie, bare themselues so manfullie, that in all conflicts for the
most part the victorie remained on their sides. The Gascoignes also tooke part with
king John, and continued in dutifull obedience towards him, for the which their loialtie
he was readie to consider them with princelie gifts and beneficiall rewards, in such bountifull
wise, that he gaue vnto a Noble man of that countrie named Moreue, the summe of
28 thousand marks, to leuie &amp; wage thirtie thousand men to aid him at his comming ouer

make warre against king John for the withholding of such lands and reuenues as they
claimed to be due vnto them, in right of their wiues. King Philip also vndertooke to

<p>The lords and other that were dismissed, tooke it verie euill, considering the great preparation
that had b&eacute;ene made for that iournie. But speciallie the mariners were sore offended,
cursing the archbishop and the said earle of Penbroke, that were knowne to be
authors of so naughtie counsell as they tooke this to be. It was thought there was neuer
so manie ships gotten togither at one time before, as were at that present, to haue attended
the king: for (as writers haue recorded) there were to the number of fourt&eacute;ene thousand
mariners that had brought their ships thither for that purpose. But as the breaking
vp of this voiage gr&eacute;eued others, so it pinched the king so n&eacute;ere the heart, that he being
come backe from the sea side to Winchester, repented so much that he had not gone forward
with his iournie, that the next daie he returned againe to the coast, and at Portesmouth
entring the sea with his ships, on the fift&eacute;enth of Julie he sailed to the Ile of Wight,
and wafted vp and downe for the space of two daies togither, till by aduice of his fr&eacute;ends
he was persuaded not to aduenture to passe ouer, sith his armie was dismissed and gone
home, and so he returned backe to the shore againe, arriuing at Scotland, n&eacute;ere vnto Warham,
the third daie after his setting foorth: yet such as were behind, and hasted after
him, thought verelie he had b&eacute;ene gone ouer, and such a brute was spread ouer all, till at
length in time the truth was knowne.</p>

<p>At his comming backe (as some write) he charged certeine of the Nobilitie with treason,
bicause they did not follow him: wherevpon shortlie after he punished them verie gr&eacute;euuouslie,
and peraduenture not without some ground of iust cause. For likelie it is
that some greater matter forced him to breake vp his iournie, than appeareth in our
writers, although Rafe Cogheshall setteth downe some reasons alledged by the archbishop
Hubert, and earle Marshall, to persuade him not to depart the realme. But peraduenture
other causes there were also of farre more importance that constreined him so
greatlie against his mind &amp; full resolution, both at the first, and now at this second time
to returne. &para; Verelie to vtter my coniecture, it may be that vpon his last determination
to go ouer, he gaue new commandement to his lords to follow him, and they peraduenture
vsed not such diligence in accomplishing his pleasure therein, as he looked they
should haue doone: or it may be, when the armie was once discharged, the souldiers
made such hast homewards, ech man towards his countrie, that it was no easie matter to
bring them backe againe in any conuenient time. But howsoeuer it was, as it had b&eacute;ene
vpon a change of purpose, he came backe againe (as before y&eacute;e haue heard.)</p>

<p>The thirt&eacute;enth of Julie Hubert archbishop of Canturburie departed this life at Tenham,
the king not being gratlie sorie for his death (as some haue written) bicause he gathered
some suspicion that he bare too much good will towards the French king. In verie d&eacute;ed
(as some write) the archbishop repented himselfe of nothing so much, as for that he had
commended king John to the Noblemen and P&eacute;ers of the realme, sith he prooued an
other manner of man than he looked to haue found him. This archbishop had gouerned
the s&eacute;e of Canturburie eleuen yeares, eight moneths, and six daies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An archbishop

<p>After his deceasse, the moonks of Canturburie without knowledge of the king, chose
one Reignold the subprior of their house to be their archbishop, who secretlie went to

great discord betwixt pope Innocent &amp; king John, since the pope would not confirme the
election, bicause he saw some p&eacute;ece of secret practise, till he might vnderstand and be
certified by report of sufficient witnesse (for that he wanted the letters commendatorie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>

the moonks being sp&eacute;edilie aduertised, and to the end they might now recouer the kings
fauour, whome they had verie sore offended in not making him priuie to the first election,
they made request vnto him, that by his nomination it might be lawfull for them to

<p>The king gladlie herevnto assented, requiring them to grant their voices vnto John Gray

moonks to gratifie the king obeied his request, and so electing the same bishop of Norwich,
they sent their procurators to Rome in the yeare following, to signifie the same vnto
the pope, and to require him to confirme this their second election, as vnmindfull of their
first, and clearelie adnihilating the same to all intents and purposes. Amongst other that
were sent to Rome about this businesse, Helias de Brantfield was one, a moonke of great

their procurators to Rome, about a quarrell which they had against the moonks there, for

In the meane time these and other like things procured the pope to reiect both the

was not a little augmented (as you shall heare h&eacute;ereafter.) Now whilest these procurators
were thus occupied in Rome, Philip the French king minding to conquer all that
which king John yet held within France, assembled an armie, and comming before the
towne of Loches, wan it, and tooke Gerard de Atie prisoner, that had so long time and

be found, who hauing prepared all things necessarie for defense, manfullie repelled the
Frenchmen, who inforced themselues to win the towne with continuall assaults and
alarms, not suffering them within to rest neither day nor night, who yet for certeine daies
togither, by the valiant incouragement of their capteine defended the towne, with great

of their incessant trauell, certeine of them that were somewhat faintharted stale ouer the
walles in the night, and ran to the Frenchmen, and for safegard of their liues instructed
them of the whole estate of the towne. The French vnderstanding that they within were
in no small feare of themselues, with such violence came vnto the walles, and renewed the
assault vpon all sides, that streightwaies they entred by force. A great number of Englishmen
were taken, and amongst other their capteine the foresaid Hubert de Burgh.
[This chanced on the vigill of S. John Baptist.]</p>

<p>After this, king Philip tooke diuerse other townes and castels in that countrie, of the
which some he raced, and some he fortified and stored with garisons of his souldiers. This
doone he passed ouer the riuer of Loir, and wan a castell situat n&eacute;ere vnto a promontorie
or head of land called Grapelitum, which was woont to be a great succour &amp; aid to Englishmen

chosen

Canturburie by
y<sup>e</sup> popes appointment.</div>

<p>In the meane while, the strife depended still in the court of Rome betwixt the two
elected archbishops of Canturburie, Reginald and John. But after the pope was fullie
informed of the manner of their elections, he disannulled them both, and procured by his
papall authoritie the moonks of Canturburie (of whome manie were then come to Rome
about that matter) to choose one Stephan Langton the cardinall of S. Chrysogon an
Englishman borne, and of good estimation and learning in the court of Rome to be their
archbishop. The moonks at the first were loth to consent thereto, alledging that they
might not lawfullie doo it without consent of their king, and of their couent.</p>

<p>But the pope as it were taking the word out of their mouths, said vnto them, "Doo
y&eacute;e not consider that we haue full authoritie and power in the church of Canturburie:
neither is the assent of kings or princes to be looked for vpon elections celebrated in the
presence of the apostolike s&eacute;e. Wherefore I command you by vertue of your obedience,
and vpon paine of curssing, that you being such and so manie here as are sufficient for
the election, to choose him to your archbishop, whome I shall appoint to you for father
and pastor of your soules." The moonks doubting to offend the pope, consented all of
them to gratifie him, except Helias de Brantfield, who refused. And so the foresaid
Stephan Langton being elected of them, was confirmed of the pope, who signified by
letters the whole state therof to king John, commending the said Stephan as archbishop
vnto him.</p>

<p>The king sore offended in his mind that the bishop of Norwich was thus put beside that
dignitie, to the which he had aduanced him, caused foorthwith all the goods of the moonks
of Canturburie to be confiscate to his vse, and after banished them the relme, as well I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
meane those at home, as those that were at Rome, and herewith wrote his letters vnto the
pope, giuing him to vnderstand for answer, "that he would neuer consent that Stephan
which had b&eacute;ene brought vp &amp; alwaies conuersant with his enimies the Frenchmen,
should now enioy the rule of the bishoprike and dioces of Canturburie. Moreouer, he
declared in the same letters, that he maruelled not a little what the pope ment, in that he
did not consider how necessarie the fr&eacute;endship of the king of England was to the s&eacute;e of
Rome, sith there came more gains to the Romane church out of that kingdome, than out
of any other realme on this side the mountaines. He added hereto, that for the liberties
of his crowne he would stand to the death, if the matter so required. And as for the
election of the bishop of Norwich vnto the s&eacute;e of Canturburie, sith it was profitable to
him and to his realme, he meant not to release it.</p>

<p>"Moreouer, he declared that if he might not be heard and haue his mind, he would
suerlie restraine the passages out of this realme, that none should go to Rome, least his
land should be so emptied of monie and treasure, that he should want sufficient abilitie to
beat backe and expell his enimies that might attempt inuasion against the same. Lastlie
of all he concluded, sith the archbishops, bishops, abbats, and other ecclesiasticall persons,
as well of his realme of England, as of other his lands and dominions, were sufficientlie
furnished with knowledge, that he would not go for anie n&eacute;ed that should driue
him thereto, to s&eacute;eke iustice or iudgement at the prescript of any forren persons."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The popes answer
vnto the
king.</div>

<p>The pope greatlie maruelling hereat, wrote againe to the king, requiring him to absteine
from the spoiling of those men that were priuileged by the canons of the church,
"that he would place the moonks againe in their house and possessions, and receiue the
archbishop canonicallie elected and confirmed, the which for his learning and knowledge,
as well in the liberall sciences, as in holy scripture, was thought worthie to be admitted to
a prebend in Paris: and what estimation he himselfe had of him it appeared, in that he
had written to him thrice since he was made cardinall, declaring that although he was
minded to call him to his seruice, yet he was glad that he was promoted to an higher
roome; adding further, how there was good cause that he should haue consideration of
him, bicause he was borne within his land, of father and mother that were his faithfull
subiects, and for that he had a prebend in the church of Yorke, which was greater and of
more dignitie than that he had in Paris. Whereby not onelie by reason of flesh and
bloud, but also by hauing ecclesiasticall dignitie and office, it could not be but that he
loued him and his realme with sincere affection."</p>

<p>Manie other reasons the pope alledged in his letters to king John, to haue persuaded
him to the allowing of the election of Stephan Langton. But king John was so far from
giuing care to the popes admonitions, that he with more crueltie handled all such, not
onelie of the spiritualtie, but also of the temporaltie, which by any manner means had
aided the forenamed Stephan. The pope being hereof aduertised, thought good not to
suffer such contempt of his authoritie, as he interpreted it; namelie, in a matter that
touched the iniurious handling of men within orders of the church. Which example
might procure hinderance, not to one priuat person alone, but to the whole estate of the
spiritualtie, which he would not suffer in any wise to be suppressed. Wherefore he decr&eacute;ed
with sp&eacute;ed to deuise remedie against that large increasing misch&eacute;efe. And though
there was no sp&eacute;edier waie to redresse the same, but by excommunication, yet he would
not vse it at the first towards so mightie a prince, but gaue him libertie and time to consider
his offense and trespasse so committed.</p>

discharged

<p>&para; These things being brought to this issue, the further narration of them shall staie for

For vpon the seauenth of June, the bailiffes of London, Roger Winchester and Edmund
Hardell were discharged, and Serle the mercer and Hugh of saint Albons chosen in their
roomes. The two former bailiffes were discharged and commited to prison by the kings
commandement, vpon displeasure taken against them bicause they had resisted his purueier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
of wheat, and would not suffer him to conueie anie of that kind of graine out of the citie,
till the citie was stored. The thirtie and fiue rulers of the citie, hauing fulfilled the kings
commandement to them directed for the discharging of those bailiffes, and imprisoning
them, did after take aduice thither, and appointed a certeine number of themselues
with other to ride vnto the king, as then being at Langley, to obteine pardon for the said
bailiffes, and so comming togither, they made such excuse in the matter, shewing
further, that at the same season there was such scarsitie of wheat in the citie, that the
common people were at point to haue made an insurrection about the same. By which
means, and through fr&eacute;endship which they had in the court, the king was so satisfied,
that he released them from prison, and pardoned their offenses.</p>

But now againe to our purpose. The pope perceiuing that king John continued
still in his former mind (which he called obstinacie) sent ouer his bulles into England,
directed to William bishop of London, to Eustace bishop of Elie, and to Mauger bishop
of Worcester, commanding them that vnlesse king John would suffer peaceablie the archbishop
of Canturburie to occupie his s&eacute;e, and his moonks their abbie, they should put
both him and his land vnder the sentence of interdiction, denouncing him and his land

but that was in vaine: for the king in a great rage sware, that if either they or any other
presumed to put his land vnder interdiction, he would incontinentlie therevpon send all
the prelats within the realme out of the same vnto the pope, and seize all their goods
vnto his owne vse. And further he added, that what Romans soeuer he found within
the precinct of any his dominions, he would put out their eies, and slit their noses, and
so send them packing to Rome, that by such marks they might be knowne from all other
nations of the world. And herewith he commanded the bishops to packe out of his sight,
if they loued their owne health and preseruation.</p>

and after in all other places where they came. Then perceiuing that the K. ment
not to stoope for all this which they had doone, but rather sought to be reuenged vpon

knew to fauour their dooings, banishing them the realme, and seizing their goods also
into his hands. Howbeit the most part of the prelats wiselie prouided for themselues in

<div class="sidenote">An heauie time

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>&para; It was a miserable time now for pr&eacute;ests and churchmen, which were spoiled on
euerie hand, without finding remedie against those that offered them wrong. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
reported that in the borders of Wales, the officers of a shiriffe brought before the king
a fellow which had robbed and slaine a pr&eacute;est, desiring to vnderstand his pleasure what
should be doone with that offender: vnto whom the king made this answer, "He hath
slaine mine enimie, and therefore set him at libertie."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord William
de Breuse.</div>

<p>The king also doubting least the pope should proc&eacute;ed further, and absolue all his subiects
of their allegiance which they owght to him, and that his lords would happilie reuolt
and forsake him in this his trouble, tooke hostages of them whom he most suspected.
And as the messengers, which were sent abroad for that purpose, came vnto the lord
William de Breuse, requiring to haue his sonnes for the said purpose, his wife (like a
quick and hastie dame) taking the word out of hir husbands mouth, made this round
answer, "that she would not deliuer hir sonnes vnto king John, who alreadie had slaine his
owne nephue Arthur, whome he ought rather honourablie to haue loued and preserued."
These words being signified vnto the king, set him in such an heat against hir husband
(though he rebuked hir sharpelie for the same) that the said lord was glad togither
with his wife and children to fl&eacute;e out of the realme into Ireland for safegard of their
liues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Londo&#772;n Bridge
repaired.</div>

<p>Whereas before this time London bridge was made of timber, and was ruled, guided,
&amp; repaired by a fraternitie or colledge of pr&eacute;ests; this y&eacute;ere by great aid of the citizens
of London and others passing that waie, the same bridge was begun to be made of
stone. And in the same yeare S. Marie Oueries in Southwarke was begun to be repaired.
The same yeare also, the citizens of London made such suit vnto the king, that he
granted vnto them by his letters patents, licence to choose to themselues a maior, and
two shiriffes euerie yeare. After which grant vnto them confirmed, they chose for their
maior Henrie Fitz Alwin, who was sworne and charged at that present maior of that
citie, vpon the day of saint Michaell the archangell, in the said tenth yeare of king
John his reigne. On the same day and yeare, were Peter Duke &amp; Thomas Nele
sworne for shiriffes. Thus the name of bailiffes from thenceforth was clearelie extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>John Stow.</i></div>

<p>But here y&eacute;e haue to vnderstand, that this Henrie Fitz Alwin had b&eacute;ene maior of
London long before this time, euen from the first yeare of king Richard (as John Stow
hath gathered out of ancient instruments and records) vnto this present tenth yeare of
king John, and now vpon grant made to the citizens, that it should be lawfull for them
to choose euerie yeare a maior, and two shiriffes, for the better gouernment of their
citie, the said Henrie Fitz Alwin was newlie by them elected, and likewise afterwards
from yeare to yeare, till he departed this life, which chanced in the yeare 1213, and
fift&eacute;enth of king Johns reigne, so that he continued maior of the same citie of London,
by the terme of twentie and foure yeares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The signification
of this
word Maire.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Wulf. Laz.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Berosus.</i></div>

<p>&para; Now therefore bicause it appeareth here how the gouernors of the citie of London
had their names altered for their greater honour, and the state of gouernment thereby
partlie changed, or rather confirmed; I haue thought good (though verie br&eacute;efelie) to
touch somewhat the signification of this word Maire, before I proc&eacute;ed any further with
the rest of this historie. The ancient inhabitants of Franconia, or Frankenland, from
whome the Frenchmen are descended, and their neighbors the old Saxons, of whom
the Englishmen haue their originall, being people of Germanie, and descended (as Berosus
seith) of the old Hebrues, haue reteined manie Hebrue words, either from the
beginning, or else borowed them abroad in other regions which they conquered, passing
by force of armes through a great part of the world. For no doubt, by conuersation
with those people whom they subdued, they brought home into their owne countrie and
toong manie borowed words, so that their language hath no small store of them fetched
out of sundrie strange toongs.</p>

<p>Now among other old words remaining in their toong, this word Mar was one, which
in Hebrue signifieth Dominus, (that is to saie, lord) but pronounced now somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
corruptlie Maire. So as it is to be supposed, hereof it came to passe that the head
officer and lieutenant to the prince, as well in London as in other cities and townes of
the realme, are called by that name of maior, though in the cities of London and Yorke,
for an augmentation of honour by an ancient custome (through ignorance what the title
of maire dooth signifie) they haue an addition, and are intituled by the name of lord
maire, where Maire simplie pronounced of it selfe, signifieth no lesse than lord, without
any such addition. Thus much for the name of Maire. And now to proc&eacute;ed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The eschequer remoued.</div>

<p>King John holding his Christmasse this yeare at Bristow, set foorth a commandement,
whereby he restreined the taking of wild foule. About the same time, Henrie duke of
Suaben came into England from the emperour Otho, and receiving no small portion of
monie of the king, departed backe into his owne countrie againe. In the vigil of the
Epiphanie also, the kings second sonne was borne, and named Richard after his vncles
name. And the court of the eschequer was remoued from Westminster vnto Northampton.
Moreouer in the same yeare, Walter Gray was made lord chancellour, who in all
thing studied to satisfie the kings will and purpose, for the which he incurred great indignation
of the cleargie, and other that fauoured not the proc&eacute;edings of the king.</p>

<p>&para; It was suerlie a rufull thing to consider the estate of this realme at that present,
when as the king neither trusted his p&eacute;eres, neither the nobilitie fauoured the king; no,
there were verie few that trusted one another, but ech one hid &amp; hourded vp his wealth,
looking dailie when another should come and enter vpon the spoile. The communaltie
also grew into factions, some fauouring, &amp; some cursing the king, as they bare affection.
The cleargie was likewise at dissention, so that nothing preuailed but malice and spite,
which brought foorth and spred abroad the fruits of disobedience to all good lawes and
orders, greatlie to the disquieting of the whole state. So that herein we haue a perfect
view of the perplexed state of princes, ch&eacute;eflie when they are ouerswaied with forren &amp;
prophane power, and not able to assure themselues of their subiects allegiance and loialtie.

<p>King John notwithstanding that the realme was thus wholie interdicted and vexed, so
that no pr&eacute;ests could be found to saie seruice in churches or chapels, made no great
account thereof as touching any offense towards God or the pope: but rather mistrusting
the hollow hearts of his people, he tooke a new oth of them for their faithfull allegiance,
and immediatlie therevpon assembled an armie to go against Alexander king of Scots,
vnto whome (as he had heard) diuerse of the nobilitie of this realme were fled, which
Alexander was the second of that name that had ruled the Scots, and latelie before was
entred into the rule as lawfull successor to the crowne of Scotland, by the death of his
father K. William.</p>

<p>In this meane while also Stephan archbishop of Canturburie lamenting (as some haue

obteined of pope Innocent, that vpon certeine dais it might be lawfull for an appointed
number of pr&eacute;ests within the realme of England, to celebrate diuine seruice, that is to
say, for those of conuentuall churches once in the w&eacute;eke. But the moonks of the white

they had at the appointment of their principall abbat presumed to celebrate the sacraments
without the popes consent or knowledge.</p>

<p>In like maner on the other side, king John hauing his armie in a readinesse, hasted
foorth towards the borders of Scotland, and comming to the castell of Norham, prepared
to inuade the Scots. But king Alexander wanting power to giue him battell, sought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
come vnto some fr&eacute;endlie agr&eacute;ement with him, and so by counsell of his lords, casting off
his armour, he came to the king, and for a great summe of gold (or 11 thousand marks of
siluer as some write) with much adoo he purchased peace, deliuering two of his daughters
in hostage for more assurance of his dealing. Wherevpon king John, after his returne
from Norham, which was about the 24 of June, shewed himselfe not a little displeased
with those of the nobilitie, which had refused to attend vpon him in that iournie, hauing
receiued streit commandement from him to attend vpon him at that time. Certes the
cause why they refused to follow him, was euident, as they said, in that they knew him to
stand accursed by the pope. About the same time also, when corne began to wax ripe,
to reuenge himselfe of them that had refused to go with him in that iournie, he caused the
pales of all the parks &amp; forrests which he had within his realme to be throwne downe,
&amp; the diches to be made plaine, that the d&eacute;ere breaking out and ranging abroad in the
corne fields, might destroie &amp; eat vp the same before it could be ripened, for which act
(if it were so in d&eacute;ed) manie a bitter cursse proc&eacute;eded from the mouths of the poore
husbandmen towards the kings person, and not vnworthilie. Moreouer in this season
the Welshmen (which thing had not b&eacute;ene s&eacute;ene afore time) came vnto Woodstoke, and
there did homage vnto the king, although the same was chargeable, aswell to the rich as
the poore so to come out of their countrie.</p>

<p>About the same time also, it chanced that a pr&eacute;est slue a woman at Oxford, and when
the kings officers could not find him that had committed the murther, they apprehended
thr&eacute;e other pr&eacute;ests not guiltie of the fact, and streightway hanged them vp without iudgement.
With which crueltie others of the Vniuersitie being put in feare, departed thence
in great numbers, and came not thither againe of a long time after, some of them repairing
to Cambridge, and some to Reading to applie their studies in those places, leauing
Oxford void. The same yeare one Hugh archdeacon of Welles, and k&eacute;eper of the kings
great seale, was nominated bishop of Lincolne; and herewithall he craued licence to go
ouer into France vnto the archbishop of Rouen, that he might be consecrated of him.
Wherewith the king was contented and gladlie gaue him leaue, who no sooner got ouer
into Normandie, but he streight tooke the high waie to Rome, and there receiued his
consecration of Stephan archbishop of Canturburie. Now when the king vnderstood
this matter, and saw the dulnesse of the bishop, he was in a wonderfull chafe toward
him, and thervpon made port-sale of all his goods, and receiued the profit of the reuenues
belonging to the s&eacute;e of Lincolne for his own vse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cementarius.</div>

<p>&para; There liued in those daies a diuine named Alexander Cementarius, surnamed Theologus,
who by his preaching incensed the king greatlie vnto all crueltie (as the moonks
and friers saie) against his subiects, affirming that the generall scourge wherewith the
people were afflicted, chanced not through the princes fault, but for the wickednesse of
his people, for the king was but the rod of the Lords wrath, and to this end a prince was
ordeined, that he might rule the people with a rod of iron, and breake them as an earthen
vessell, to chaine the mighty in fetters, &amp; the noble men in iron manacles. He did s&eacute;e
(as it should s&eacute;eme) the euill disposed humors of the people concerning their dutifull
obedience which they ought to haue borne to their naturall prince king John, and therefore
as a doctrine most necessarie in that dangerous time, he taught the people how they
were by Gods lawes bound in dutie to obeie their lawfull prince, and not through any
wicked persuasion of busie heads and lewd discoursers, to be carried away to forget their
loiall allegiance, and so to fall into the damnable sinke of rebellion.</p>

<p>He went about also to prooue with likelie arguments, that it apperteined not to the
pope, to haue to doo concerning the temporall possessions of any kings or other potentats
touching the rule and gouernment of their subiects, sith no power was granted to Peter
(the speciall and ch&eacute;efe of the apostles of the Lord) but onlie touching the church, and
matters apperteining therevnto. By such doctrine of him set foorth, he wan in such

that all those that inhabited vpon the sea coasts in the champaine countries, came in,

twentie of the ch&eacute;efest rulers within Ireland, which came to the king at his comming to
Dublin, and there did to him homage and fealtie as apperteined. The king at the same
time ordeined also, that the English lawes should be vsed in that land, and appointed
shiriffes and other officers to haue the order of the countrie, to rule the same according
to the English ordinances. After this, he marched forward into the land, and tooke
diuerse fortresses and strong holds of his enimies, which fled before him, for feare to be
apprehended as Walter de Lacie and manie other. At length, comming into the countrie
of Meth, he besieged a castell, wherein the wife of William de Breuse, and hir sonne
named also William were inclosed, but they found means to escape before the castell was

<p>&para; We read in an old historie of Flanders, written by one whose name is not knowne,
but printed at Lions by Guillaume Rouille, in the yeare 1562, that the said ladie, wife
to the lord William de Breuse, presented vpon a time vnto the qu&eacute;ene of England, a
gift of foure hundred kine, and one bull, of colour all white, the eares excepted, which
were red. Although this tale may s&eacute;eme incredible, yet if we shall consider that the said
Breuse was a lord marcher, and had goodlie possessions in Wales, and on the marshes, in
which countries the most part of the peoples substance consisteth in cattell, it may carrie
with it the more likelihood of truth. And suerlie the same author writeth of the iournie
made this yeare into Ireland, so sensiblie, and namelie touching the manners of the Irish,
that he s&eacute;emeth to haue had good informations, sauing that he misseth in the names of
men and places, which is a fault in maner common to all forreine writers. Touching
the death of the said ladie, he saith, that within eleuen daies after she was committed to
prison h&eacute;ere in England, she was found dead, sitting betwixt hir sonnes legs, who likewise
being dead, sate directlie vp against a wall of the chamber, wherein they were kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>

which bare great rule in that quarter before. The bishop then being appointed deputie
and ch&eacute;efe iustice of Ireland, reformed the coine there, causing the same to be made of
like weight and finenesse to the English coine, so that the Irish monie was currant, as
well in England, as in Ireland, being of the like weight, forme, and finenesse to the
English. Moreouer, those that inhabited the wood-countries and the mounteine places,
though they would not as then submit themselues, he would not at that time further pursue,
bicause winter was at hand, which in that countrie approcheth timelie in the yeare.

<p>&para; Touching the maner of this interdiction there haue b&eacute;ene diuerse opinions, some
haue said, that the land was interdicted throughlie, and the churches and houses of religion
closed vp, that no where was anie diuine seruice vsed: but it was not so streit, for
there were diuerse places occupied with diuine seruice all that time, by certeine priuiledges
purchased either then or before. Children were also christened, and men houseled
and annoiled through all the land, except such as were in the bill of excommunication
by name expressed. But to our purpose.</p>

<p>King John, after that the legats were returned toward Rome againe, punished diuerse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of those persons which had refused to go with him into Wales, in like maner as he had
doone those that refused to go with him into Scotland: he tooke now of ech of them for
euerie knights f&eacute;e two marks of siluer, as before is recited. About the same time also,
Reginald earle of Bullongne being accursed in like maner as king John was, for certeine
oppressions doone to poore men, and namelie to certeine pr&eacute;ests, fled ouer into England,
bicause the French king had banished him out of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The like league was made in the same first yeare of king
John betwixt him &amp; Ferdinando earle of Flanders.</div>

<p>The ch&eacute;efest cause of the French kings displeasure towards this earle, may s&eacute;eme to
proc&eacute;ed of the amitie and league which was concluded betwixt king John, and the said
earle, in the first yeare of the said king's reigne, whereby they bound themselues either to
other, not to make anie peace, or to take anie truce with the king of France, without
either others consent first thereto had, and that if after anie agr&eacute;ement taken betwixt
them and the king of France, he should chance to make warre against either of them,
then should the other aid and assist him, against whom such ware should be made, to the
vttermost of his power.</p>

<p>This league was accorded to remaine for euer betwixt them and their heires, with suerties
sworne on either part: and for the king of England, these, whose names insue, William
Marshall earle of Penbroke, Ranulfe earle of Chester, Robert earle of Leicester,
Baldwine earle of Albemarle, William earle of Arundell, Ralfe earle of Augi, Robert de
Mellet, Hugh de Gourney, William de Kaeu, Geffrey de Cella, Roger conestable of Chester,

and Peter Sauenie. For the earle, these were suerties, Anselme de Kaeu, Guy Lieschans,
Ralfe the said earles brother, &amp;c. But now to returne.</p>

<p>After that the earle of Bullongne was expelled out of France (as before ye haue heard)
he came ouer to king John, and was of him ioifullie receiued, hauing thr&eacute;e hundred
pounds of reuenues in land to him assigned within England, for the which he did homage
and fealtie vnto him. Shortlie after this also, died William de Breuse the elder, which
fled from the face of king John out of Ireland into France, and departing this life at
Corbell, was buried at Paris in the abbeie of S. Victor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<p>In the meane time pope Innocent, after the returne of his legats out of England, perceiuing
that king John would not be ordered by him, determined with the consent of his
cardinals and other councellours, and also at the instant suit of the English bishops and
other prelats being there with him, to depriue king John of his kinglie state, and so first
absolued all his subiects and vassals of their oths of allegiance made vnto the same king,
and after depriued him by solemne protestation of his kinglie administration and dignitie,
and lastlie signified that his depriuation vnto the French king and other christian princes,
admonishing them to pursue king John, being thus depriued, forsaken, and condemned
as a common enimie to God and his church. He ordeined furthermore, that whosoeuer
imploied goods or other aid to vanquish and ouercome that disobedient prince, should
remaine in assured peace of the church, as well as those which went to visit the sepulchre
of our Lord, not onlie in their goods and persons, but also in suffrages for sauing of their
soules.</p>

<p>But yet that it might appeare to all men, that nothing could be more ioifull vnto his
holinesse, than to haue king John to repent his trespasses committed, and to aske forgiuenesse
for the same, he appointed Pandulph, which latelie before was returned to Rome,
with a great number of English exiles, to go into France, togither with Stephan the archbishop
of Canturburie, and the other English bishops, giuing him in commandement, that
repairing vnto the French king, he should communicate with him all that which he had
appointed to be doone against king John, and to exhort the French king to make warre
vpon him, as a person for his wickednesse excommunicated. Moreouer this Pandulph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>

vnto king John such letters as the pope had written for his better instruction, and to
s&eacute;eke by all means possible to draw him from his naughtie opinion.</p>

<p>In the meane time, when it was bruted through the realme of England, that the pope
had released the people &amp; absolued them of their oth of fidelitie to the king, and that he
was depriued of his gouernement by the popes sentence, by little and little a great number

<p>The same yeare king John held his Christmasse at Windsor, and in the Lent following,
on midlent sundaie being at London, he honoured the lord Alexander sonne and heire to
the king of Scots, with the high order of knighthood. And (as I find it mentioned by
some writers) wheras he vnderstood how there were diuerse in Scotland, that contemning
their naturall lord and king by reason of his great age, king John went thither with an
armie to represse the rebels, and being come thither, he sent his men of war into the
inner parts of the country, who scowring the coasts, took Guthred Macwilliam capteine
of them that moued sedition, whom king John caused to be hanged on a paire of gallowes.
This Guthred was descended of the line of the ancient Scotish kings, and being assisted
with the Irishmen and Scots that fauoured not the race of the kings that presentlie reigned,
wrought them much trouble, as his father (named Donald) had doone before him, sometime
secretlie vnder hand, and sometime againe by way of open rebellion.</p>

<p>Shortlie after, the Welshmen began to sturre also, who rushing out of their owne confines,
fell vpon their next neighbours within the English marshes, wasted the countrie,
and ouerthrew diuerse castels flat to the ground. Whereof the king hauing knowledge,
assembled a mightie armie out of hand, and comming to Notingham, he hanged vp the
Welsh hostages which the last yeare he had receiued, to the number of eight and twentie
yoong striplings. And by reason he was now set in a maruellous chafe, he roughlie proc&eacute;eded
against all those whom he knew not to fauor his case: some he discharged of
their offices, other he depriued of their capteineships and other roomes, &amp; reuoked certeine
priuileges &amp; immunities granted to moonks, pr&eacute;ests, &amp; men of religion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, hauing his armie readie to passe on into Wales, he receiued letters the

of Wales, conteining in effect the aduertisement of one matter, which was to let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
know, that if he proc&eacute;eded on his iournie, he should either through treason be slaine of
his owne lords, or else be deliuered to be destroied of his enimies. The king iudging no
lesse, but that the tenor of the letters conteined a truth, brake vp his armie and returned
to London. From whence he sent messengers vnto all such lords as he suspected, commanding
them to send vnto him hostages for more assurance of their fidelities. The lords
durst not disobeie his commandement, but sent their sons, their nephues, and other their
kinsmen, accordinglie as he required, and so his rancour was appeased for a time. But
Eustace de Vescie, Robert Fitz Walter, and Stephan Ridell, being accused and suspected
of the K. for the said treason, were glad to fl&eacute;e the realme, Vescie departing into Scotland,
and the other two into France.</p>

<p>The same yeare, the church of S. Marie Oueries, and all the building vpon London
bridge on both sides the same, were consumed with fire, which was iudged to be a signification
of some mishap to follow. The king held his Christmasse this yeare at Westminster,
with no great traine of knights about him. About the same time Geffrey archbishop

But now to returne againe to the practises of the popes legats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French king prepared to inuade England.</div>

<p>Ye shall vnderstand, the French king being requested by Pandulph the popes legat, to
take the warre in hand against king John, was easilie persuaded thereto of an inward
hatred that he bare vnto our king, and therevpon with all diligence made his prouision of
men, ships, munition and vittell, in purpose to passe ouer into England: and now was
his nauie readie rigged at the mouth of Saine, and he in greatest forwardnesse, to take his
iournie. When Pandulph vpon good considerations thought first to go eftsoones, or at
the least wise to send into England, before the French armie should land there, and to
assaie once againe, if he might induce the king to shew himselfe reformable vnto the popes
pleasure: king John hauing knowledge of the French kings purpose and ordinance,
assembled his people, and lodged with them alongst by the coast towards France, that he
might resist his enimies, and k&eacute;epe them off from landing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 15.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The great armie which K. John assembled togither.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Norwich.</div>

<p>Here writers declare, that he had got togither such an armie of men out of all the
parts of his realme, both of lords, knights, gentlemen, yeomen, &amp; other of the commons,
that notwithstanding all the prouision of vittels that might possible be recouered, there
could not be found sufficient store to susteine the huge multitude of them that were
gathered alongst the coast, namelie at Douer, Feuersham, Gipsewich, and other places.
Wherevpon the capteins discharged and sent home a great number of the commons,
reteining onelie the men of armes, yeomen, and fr&eacute;eholders, with the crossebowes and
archers. There came likewise to the kings aid at the same time, the bishop of Norwich
out of Ireland, bringing with him fiue hundred men of armes, &amp; a great sort of other
horssemen.</p>

<p>To conclude, there was est&eacute;emed of able men assembled togither in the armie on Barhamdowne,
what of chosen men of armes, and valient yeomen, and other armed men, the
number of sixtie thousand: so that if they had b&eacute;ene all of one mind, and well bent towards
the seruice of their king and defense of their countrie, there had not b&eacute;ene a prince in
christendome, but that they might haue b&eacute;ene able to haue defended the realme of England
against him. He had also prouided a nauie of ships farre stronger than the French
kings, readie to fight with them by sea, if the case had so required.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Two knights of the temple.</div>

<p>But as he lay thus readie, n&eacute;ere to the coast, to withstand and beat backe his enimies,
there arriued at Douer two Templers, who comming before the king, declared vnto him
that they were sent from Pandulph the popes legat, who for his profit coueted to talke
with him: for he had (as they affirmed) meanes to propone, whereby he might be reconciled,
both to God and his church, although he were adiudged in the court of Rome, to
haue forfeited all the right which he had to his kingdome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The legat Pandulph co&#772;meth ouer.</div>

<p>The king vnderstanding the meaning of the messengers sent them backe againe to bring
ouer the legat, who incontinentlie came ouer to Douer, of whose arriuall when the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
was aduertised, he went thither, and receiued him with all due honour and reuerence.
Now after they had talked togither a little, and courteouslie saluted each other (as the
course of humanitie required) the legat (as it is reported) vttered these words following.</p>


<h2>The sawcie sp&eacute;ech of proud Pandulph the popes lewd legat,
to king Iohn, in the presumptuous popes behalfe.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap fauxdc">I</span> doo not thinke that you are ignorant, how pope Innocent, to do that which to his
dutie apperteineth, hath both absolued your subiects of that oth which they made
vnto you at the beginning, and also taken from you the gouernance of England, according
to your deserts, and finallie giuen commandement vnto certeine princes of Christendome,
to expell you out of this kingdom and to place an other in your roome; so worthilie
to punish you for your disobedience and contempt of religion: and that Philip king
of France, with the first being readie to accomplish the popes commandement, hath an
armie in a readinesse, and with his nauie newlie decked, rigged and furnished in all points,
lieth at the mouth of the riuer of Saine, looking for a prosperous wind, that as soone as it
commeth about, he may saile therewith hither into England, trusting (as he saith) with
the helpe of your owne people (which neither name you, nor will take you for their king)
to spoile you of your kingdome with small adoo, and to conquer it at his pleasure, for he
hath (as he sticketh not to protest openlie to the world) a charter made by all the
ch&eacute;efest lords of England touching their fealtie and obedience assured to him. Therfore,
sith God for your iust desert is wroth with you, and that you are as euill spoken of
by all men, as they that come against you be well reported, I would aduise you, that
whilest there is a place for grace and fauour, rather to obeie the popes iust demands, to
whose word other Christian princes are readie to giue eare, than by striuing in vaine to
cast awaie your selfe and all others that take your part, or are bent to defend your quarell
or cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">K. John deliuereth his crowne vnto Pandulph.</div>

<p>These words being thus spoken by the legat, king John as then vtterlie despairing in
his matters, when he saw himselfe constreined to obeie, was in a great perplexitie of mind,
and as one full of thought, looked about him with a frowning countenance, waieng with
himselfe what counsell were best for him to follow. At length, oppressed with the burthen
of the imminent danger and ruine, against his will, and verie loth so to haue doone,
he promised vpon his oth to stand to the popes order and decr&eacute;e. Wherefore shortlie
after (in like manner as pope Innocent had commanded) he tooke the crowne from his
owne head, and deliuered the same to Pandulph the legat, neither he, nor his heires at
anie time thereafter to receiue the same, but at the popes hands. Vpon this, he promised
to receiue Stephan the archbishop of Canturburie into his fauour, with all other the
bishops and banished men, making vnto them sufficient amends for all iniuries to them
doone, and so to pardon them, that they should not run into any danger, for that they had
rebelled against him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pandulph restoreth the crowne again to the king.</div>

<p>Then Pandulph k&eacute;eping the crowne with him for the space of fiue daies in token of
possession thereof, at length (as the popes vicar) gaue it him againe. By meanes of this
act (saith Polydor) the fame went abroad, that king John willing to continue the memorie
hereof, made himselfe vassall to pope Innocent, with condition, that his successors should
likewise from thencefoorth acknowledge to haue their right to the same kingdome from
the pope. But those kings that succ&eacute;eded king John, haue not observed any such lawes
of reconciliation, neither doo the autentike chronicles of the realme make mention of any
such surrender, so that such articles as were appointed to king John to obserue, perteined
vnto him that had offended, and not to his successors. Thus saith Polydor.</p>

<p>Howbeit, Ranulph Higden in his booke intituled Polychronicon, saith ind&eacute;ed, that king
John did not onelie bind himselfe, but his heires and successors, being kings of England,
to be feudaries vnto pope Innocent and his successors popes of Rome, that is to say,
that they should hold their dominions of them in f&eacute;e, y&eacute;elding and paieng y&eacute;erelie to the
s&eacute;e of Rome the summe of seauen hundred marks for England, and thr&eacute;e hundred marks
for Ireland. Furthermore, by report of the most autentike and approoued writers, king
John, to auoid all dangers, which (as he doubted) might insue, despairing as it were in
himselfe, or rather most speciallie for lacke of loiall dutie in his subiects, consented to all
the persuasions of Pandulph, and so (not without his great hart-gr&eacute;efe) he was contented
to take his oth, togither with sixt&eacute;ene earles and barons, who laieng their hands vpon the
holie euangelists, sware with him vpon perill of their soules, that he should stand to the
iudgement of the church of Rome, and that if he repented him, and would refuse to stand
to promise, they should then compell him to make satisfaction. H&eacute;ervpon, they being
all togither at Douer, the king and Pandulph, with the earls and barons, and a great
multitude of other people, agr&eacute;ed and concluded vpon a finall peace in forme as here

<p>Pandulph hauing thus reconciled king John, thought not good to release the excommunication,
till the king had performed all things which he had promised, and so with all
sp&eacute;ed hauing receiued eight thousand markes sterling in part of restitution to be made to
the archbishop, and the other banished men, he sailed backe into France, &amp; came to
Roan, where he declared to king Philip the effect of his trauell, and what he had doone
in England. But king Philip hauing in this meane while consumed a great masse of
monie, to the summe of sixtie thousand pounds, as he himselfe alledged, about the furniture
of his iournie, which he intended to haue made into England, vpon hope to haue
had no small aid within the realme, by reason of such bishops and other banished men as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
he had in France with him, was much offended for the reconciliation of king John, and
determined not so to breake off his enterprise, least it might be imputed to him for a great
reproch to haue b&eacute;ene at such charges and great expenses in vaine. Therefore calling
his councell togither, he declared vnto them what he purposed to doo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French
king meaneth
to proc&eacute;ed in
his iournie
against the
realme of
England.</div>

<p>All his Nobles in like manner held with him, and allowed his purpose to be verie good
and requisite, except the earle of Flanders named Ferdinando who (in hope to recouer
againe those townes, which the French king held from him in Arthois, as Aire, and
S. Omers) had ioined secretlie in league with king John, and with the earle of Bullongne,
and therefore misliked the conclusion of their aduise. Howbeit king Philip not being
yet fullie certified hereof, caused his nauie to draw alongest the coast towards Flanders,
whither he himselfe hasted to go also by land, that comming thither, he might from
thence saile ouer into England, and take land at a place to him assigned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French K.

<div class="sidenote">Gaunt besieged
by the French
king.</div>

<p>Now it came to passe, that at his comming to Graueling, he had perfect knowledge,
that the earle of Flanders was ioined in league with his enimies, wherfore he determined
first to subdue the earle, least whilest he should be out of his realme, some great trouble
or sedition might rise within his owne dominions. Therfore, leauing the enterprise which
he ment to haue made against England, he turned his power against the earle of Flanders
and first commanded his nauie to saile vnto the port of Dam, whilest he himselfe
k&eacute;eping on his iournie still by land, tooke the town of Cassile, and likewise Ypres. From
thence he went to Bruges, and besieged the towne, but he could not win it at the first,
and therefore leauing a power of men to mainteine the siege before it, he himselfe went
to Gaunt, and thereto also laid his siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>In the mean time, the earle of Flanders perceiuing that he was not able to resist so
puissant an enimie as the French king, sent ouer in hast vnto the king of England for aid.
Wherevpon king John vnderstanding that his aduersarie king Philip had turned all his
force against the earle of Flanders, and that thereby he was deliuered out of the feare of
the Frenchmens comming into England; that same nauie (which as before is recited) he
had put in a readinesse, conteining the number of fiue hundred saile, he sent streight into
Flanders with a strong armie, both of horssemen and footmen, vnder the guiding of William
duke of Holland, William Longsp&eacute;e earle of Salisburie base brother to king John,
and Reignold earle of Bullongne.</p>

<p>These capteins being now passed foorth with their fl&eacute;ets into the maine sea, espied
anon manie ships lieng without the hauen of Dam (for the number of ships of the French
fl&eacute;et was so great, that the hauen could not receiue them all, so that manie of them laie
at anchor without the hauen mouth, and all alongst the coast.) Wherefore they sent
foorth certeine shallops, to espie whether they were fr&eacute;ends or enimies, and what their
number and order was. It chanced, that the same time the men of warre which were
appointed to k&eacute;epe the French fl&eacute;et, were gone foorth, togither with a great number of
the mariners, to spoile and fetch booties abroad in the countrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English
men assaile the
French ships.</div>

<p>The English espials therefore, making semblance as though they had b&eacute;ene some fishermen
of those parts, came verie n&eacute;ere the French ships lieng at anchor, and perceiuing
them to be vnfurnished of people necessarie to defend them, came backe to their companie,
and declared what they had s&eacute;ene, certifieng their capteins that the victorie was in
their hands, if they would make sp&eacute;ed. The capteins glad of these newes, commanded
their men to make them readie to giue battell, and causing their mariners to make saile
directlie towards the French fl&eacute;et, at their first approch they wanne those tall ships that
laie at anchor abroad before the hauen, without any great resistance, the mariners onelie
making request to haue their liues saued. The other smaller vessels which (after the
tide was gone) remained vpon the sands (spoiling them first of their tackle and other
things that would serue to vse) they consumed with fire, the mariners escaping by flight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English
men wanne the
French ships.</div>

<p>Thus the Englishmen hauing dispatched this businesse with good successe, did set
vpon those ships that laie in harbrough within the hauen. But here was hard hold for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
while, bicause the narrownesse of the place would not giue any great aduantage to the
greater number. And those Frenchmen that were gone abroad into the countrie, perceiuing
that the enimies were come, by the running awaie of the mariners, returned with
all sp&eacute;ed to their ships to aid their fellowes, and so made valiant resistance for a time,
till the Englishmen getting on land, and ranging themselues on either side of the hauen,
beat the Frenchmen so on the sides, and the ships grapling togither on front, that they
fought as it had bin in a pitcht field, till that finallie the Frenchmen were not able to
susteine the force of the Englishmen, but were constreined (after long fight and great
slaughter) to y&eacute;eld themselues prisoners.</p>

<p>The English capteins glad of this victorie gotten, contrarie to expectation, first gaue
thanks to God for the same, and then manning thr&eacute;e hundred of those French ships,
which they had taken fraught with corne, wine, oile, flesh, and other vittels, and also
with armour, they sent them awaie into England, and afterwards they set fire vpon the
residue that laie on ground, which were aboue an hundred, bicause they were drawne vp
so farre vpon the sands, that they could not easilie get them out, without their further
inconuenience. After this, comming on land with their power, they marched foorth into
the countrie in good order of battell, to the end that if they should encounter with king
Philip by the way comming to the rescue of his ships, they might be readie to giue them
battell, which thing was not deuised, without good and great consideration.</p>

<p>For king Philip being certified of the danger wherein his ships stood by the sudden
comming of his enimies, and therewithall being in good hope to come to their succours
in time, and yer the Englishmen had wrote their full feat, he raised his siege, and made
hast toward the coast: but as he was comming forward towards his nauie, he was aduertised
that the enimies had woone all his whole fl&eacute;et, and were now marching foorth to
m&eacute;et him, and to giue him battell. Also it was told him, how Ferdinando the earle of
Flanders, being certified of the victorie atchiued by his fr&eacute;ends, followed at his backe.
Wherefore, least he should s&eacute;eme ouer rashlie to commit himselfe into manifest perill, he
staied a little from Bruges, and there incamped for that day, as if he ment to abide the
comming of his enimies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French K.
returneth into
France.</div>

<p>The next morrow he raised and returned towards France, the verie same waie that he
came, no man pursuing him. For the Englishmen contented with that victorie which
they had gotten, thought it not necessarie to follow him with their further hazard. In the
meane time, king John receiuing newes of this prosperous victorie thus gotten by his
people, did woonderfullie reioise for the same, conceiuing an hope, that all his businesse
would now come forward and growe to good successe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matt. Paris.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Iacob. Meir.</i></div>

<p>&para; This is the truth of this historie, as some authors haue set it foorth. But Iames
Meir in his discourse of Flanders declareth the matter somwhat otherwise, as thus: Vpon
the thursdaie before the Pentecost (saith he) the English fl&eacute;et setting vpon the French
nauie, which laie at anchor in the hauen of Dam, drowned certeine of the French vessels,
and tooke to the number of foure, which they conueied awaie with them. Ferdinando
the earle of Flanders hauing an armie of men readie by land, was lodged the same time
not far off from the coast and therefore hearing what had chanced, came the next day, and
ioined with the Englishmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Englishmen
and Flemings
vanquished
by the
French force.</div>

<p>There were yet remaining also diuerse other of the French ships (besides those which
the Englishmen had sunke and taken) which were drawne vp further into the land ward.
The earle of Flanders therefore, and the English capteins iudged, that it should much
hinder the French kings attempts, if they might win those ships also with the towne of
Dam, wherin the king had laid vp a great part of his prouision for the furniture of his
warres. H&eacute;erevpon the Englishmen were set on land, and ioining with the earls power,
they marched strait towards Dam. This was vpon Whitsun &eacute;euen, on the which day, as
they were most busie in assaulting the towne and ships which laie there in the hauen, the
French king being come awaie from Gaunt, suddenlie set vpon them, and though in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
beginning he found sharpe resistance, yet in the end, the Englishmen and Flemings
ouerset with the great multitude of the Frenchmen, were put to flight, and chased to their
ships, with the losse of two thousand men, besides those that were taken prisoners,
amongst the which were found to be 22 knights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The French
king burneth
his ships.</div>

<p>The earle of Flanders with the earles of Bullen and Salisburie, doubting to lose their
ships, and late gotten bootie, sailed strait into one of the Iles of Zeland called Walkeren.
Then the French king constraining them of Gaunt, Bruges, and Ypres, to deliuer vnto
him pledges, caused the towne of Dam, and his ships lieng there in the hauen to be
burned, doubting least they should come into the hands of his enimies. This doone, he
returned into France, leauing his sonne Lewes and the earle of S. Paule in garrison at
Lisle and Doway, and for great sums of monie, which by agr&eacute;ement he receiued of the
townes of Gaunt, Bruges, and Ypres, he restored vnto them their pledges. Thus saith
Meire: and Matthew Paris differeth not much from him touching the successe which
chanced to the Englishmen by land. &para; H&eacute;ere will I staie a while in the further narration
of this matter, and touch by the way a thing that happened to king John about this present
time.</p>

<p>There was in this season an heremit, whose name was Peter, dwelling about Yorke, a
man in great reputation with the common people, bicause that either inspired with some
spirit of prophesie as the people bel&eacute;eued, or else hauing some notable skill in art magike,
he was accustomed to tell what should follow after. And for so much as oftentimes his
saiengs prooued true, great credit was giuen to him as to a verie prophet: which was no
good consequence that therefore his predictions comprised vndoubted euents. Naie
rather, sith in this pseudoprophet or false foreteller of afterclaps, these necessarie concurrents

<div class="sidenote">The heremit

<p>were wanting, and that he was contrarilie qualified to that which this heptastichon comprehendeth,
necessarilie it foloweth, that he was not as he was taken, but rather a deluder
of the people, and an instrument of satan raised vp for the inlargement of his kingdome:
as the sequele of this discourse importeth. This Peter about the first of Januarie last
past, had told the king, that at the feast of the Ascension it should come to passe, that he
should be cast out of his kingdome. And (whether, to the intent that his words should
be the better bel&eacute;eued, or whether vpon too much trust of his owne cunning) he offered
himselfe to suffer death for it, if his prophesie prooued not true. Herevpon being committed
to prison within the castell of Corf, when the day by him prefixed came, without
any other notable damage vnto king John, he was by the kings commandement drawne
from the said castell, vnto the towne of Warham, &amp; there hanged, togither with his sonne.</p>

<p>The people much blamed king John, for this extreame dealing, bicause that the heremit
was supposed to be a man of great vertue, and his sonne nothing guiltie of the offense
committed by his father (if any were) against the king. Moreouer, some thought, that
he had much wrong to die, bicause the matter fell out euen as he had prophesied: for
the day before the Ascension day, king John had resigned the superioritie of his kingdome
(as they tooke the matter) vnto the pope, and had doone to him homage, so that
he was no absolute king ind&eacute;ed, as authors affirme. One cause, and that not the least
which mooued king John the sooner to agr&eacute;e with the pope, rose through the words of
the said heremit, that did put such a feare of some great mishap in his hart, which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
grow through the disloialtie of his people, that it made him y&eacute;eld the sooner. But to the
matter againe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King John
writeth to the
archbishop &amp;

to returne.</div>

<p>King John (after his capteins in Flanders had sped so well as before y&eacute;e haue heard)
prepared to make a voiage into Guien, not much regarding the matter, in that the realme
stood as yet interdicted. But when he vnderstood by his lords, that they would not go
with him except the interdicting might first be released, and he clearlie absolued of the
popes cursse, to the end that Gods wrath and the popes being fullie pacified towards him,
he might with better sp&eacute;ed mooue and mainteine the warres, he was constreined to
change his purpose, and so comming to Winchester, dispatched foorth a messenger with
letters, signed with the hands of foure and twentie earles and barons, to the archbishop
of Canturburie, and the bishops of London, Lincolne, and Hereford, as then soiourning
in France, requiring them with all the other banished men to returne into England, promising
them by his letters patents, not onelie a sure safeconduct for their comming ouer,
but that he would also forget all passed displeasures, and frankelie restore vnto euerie man
all that by his means had b&eacute;ene wrongfullie taken from them, and as yet by him deteined.</p>

other the banished men, they went to Winchester, where the king yet remained, who
hearing that the bishops were come, went foorth to receiue them, and at his first m&eacute;eting
with the archbishop of Canturburie, he kn&eacute;eled downe at his f&eacute;et, and besought him of
forgiuenesse, and that it would please him and the other bishops also to prouide for the
rel&eacute;efe of the miserable state of the realme. Herewith the water standing in diuerse of
their eies on both sides, they entred into the citie, the people greatlie reioising to behold
the head of the common-wealth agr&eacute;e at length with the members. This was in the yeare

<p>King John required of the archbishop (hauing as then the popes power in his hands,
bicause he was his legat,) to be absolued, promising vpon his solemne receiued oth, that
he would (afore all things) defend the church and the order of priesthood from receiuing
anie wrongs. Also, that he would restore the old lawes made by the ancient kings of England,
and namelie those of S. Edward, which were almost extinguished and forgotten.
And further, that he would make recompense to all men whom he had by anie meanes
indamaged. This doone, he was absolued by the archbishop, &amp; shortly after he sent his
oratours to Rome, to intreat with the bishop to take awaie the interdiction of the land.
On the morrow after also, the king sent his letters vnto all the shiriffes of the counties
within the realme, commanding them to summon foure lawfull men of euerie towne belonging
to the demeans of the crowne, to make their appearance at S. Albons, vpon the
4 daie of August, that they and other might make inquisition of the losses which euerie

<p>The archbishop for that time taking his leaue of the king, went to Canturburie, where
he restored the moonks to their abbie, and then tooke possession of his s&eacute;e, being the two
and fortith archbishop that had ruled the same. In the meane time, the king repaired to
Portesmouth, there so take the sea to saile ouer into Poictow, committing the rule of the
realme vnto Geffrey Fitz Peter or Fitz P&eacute;ers, lord ch&eacute;efe iustice, and to the bishop of
Winchester, commanding them to vse the counsell and aduise of the archbishop of Canturburie,
in governing things touching the common-wealth. Herewith there came also
to the king a great multitude of men of warre, alledging, that they had spent in staieng
for him, and his going ouer sea all their monie, so that he must now n&eacute;eds giue them
wages, if he would haue them to passe ouer with him into France. The which when he
refused to doo, he was constreined to take the water with his owne seruants, arriuing
about a thr&eacute;e daies after at the Ile of Jersey: but perceiuing that none of his lords fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>lowed

<p>Whilest these things were thus in dooing, Geffrey Fitz Peter, and the bishop of Winchester
were come to S. Albons, togither with the archbishop of Canturburie, and other
bishops and p&eacute;eres of the realme, where the kings peace being proclaimed to all men it
was on his behalfe streitlie commanded, that the lawes of K. Henrie his grandfather
should be obserued vniuersallie within his realme, and that all vniust lawes and ordinances
should be abrogated. It was also commanded, that no shiriffe, nor forrester, nor
other minister of the kings, should vpon paine of life and limme, take violentlie anie thing

which had refused to go with him, but the archbishop of Canturburie comming to him at
Northampton, sought to appease his mood, and to cause him to staie, but yet in his
furious rage he went forward till he came to Notingham, and there with much adoo, the
archbishop following him with threatning to excommunicate all those that should aid him,
procured him to leaue off his enterprise.</p>

<p>Then the archbishop (about the fiue and twentith day of August) came to London,
there to take aduise for the reformation of things touching the good gouernement of the

orders verie necessarie (as was thought) for the state of the common-wealth, the
king doubting least the same should be a bridle for him to restreine his authoritie roiall
from dooing things to his pleasure, he began to find fault, and s&eacute;emed as though he had
repented himselfe of his large promises made for his reconciliation: but the archbishop of
Canturburie so asswaged his mood, and persuaded him, by opening vnto him what danger
would insue both to him and to his realme, if he went from the agr&eacute;ement, that he

which his grandfather king Henrie the first had by his charter granted and confirmed to

would stand to that agr&eacute;ement which he had made and promised by his oth to performe.
King John receiued this cardinall in most honorable wise, and gladlie heard him in all
things that he had to saie. This legat at his comming to Westminster, deposed the abbat
of that place, named William from his roome, for that he was accused both of wasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the reuenues of the house, and also of notable incontinencie. Moreouer the burgesses
of the towne of Oxford came vnto him to obteine absolution of their offense, in that
through their presumption, the thr&eacute;e schollers (of whom ye haue heard before) were
hanged there, to the great terror of all the residue. To be short, they were absolued and
penance inioined them, that they should strip them out of their apparell at euerie church
in the towne, and going barefooted with scourges in their hands, they should require the
benefit of absolution of euerie parish pr&eacute;est within their towne, saieng the psalme of
Miserere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A co&#772;nuocation
called by the
cardinall.</div>

<p>After this, the said cardinall called a councell or conuocation of the cleargie, to reforme
such things touching the state of the church as should be thought requisite. And
though he handled not this matter with such fauour and vprightnesse as the bishops wished
on their behalfes, yet he caused king John to restore the most part of all those goods
that remained vnspent, and also the value of halfe of those that were consumed and made
awaie, vnto those persons as well spirituall as temporall, from whom they had b&eacute;ene
taken in time of the discord betwixt him and the pope. But before all things could be
thus quieted and set in order betwixt the king and the bishops, manie m&eacute;etings were had,
as at London, Reading, Wallingford and in other places.</p>

<p>Now the archbishop and prelates for their parts thought this recompense to be but
small, in respect of the great losses and hinderances which they had susteined: and to
haue the whole restitution delaied, they tooke it not well. Howbeit the cardinall leaned
so to the kings side (hauing receiued of him to the popes vse the charter of subiection of
the realmes of England and Ireland, now bulled with gold, where at the first it was
deliuered to Pandulph sealed onelie with wax.) But their suit came to little effect, and
in the end it fell out in such wise, that their complaint was lesse regarded. Moreouer,
the rating of the value which the king should restore vnto the archbishop, and the other
bishops, was by agr&eacute;ement of the king and them togither, appointed vnto foure barons
indifferentlie chosen betwixt them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Restitution to
be made to the
bishops.</div>

<div class="sidenote">King John
commended to

<p>At length notwithstanding that deuise took no place: for it was otherwise decr&eacute;ed by
the pope, that the king should restore to them the summe of fortie thousand marks, of the
which he had paid alreadie twelue thousand, before the returne of the said archbishop
and bishops into the realme, and fift&eacute;ene thousand more at the late m&eacute;eting had betwixt
them at Reading, so that there remained onelie 13000 behind: for not onelie the king,
but also the cardinall had sent to the pope, requiring him to take direction in the matter,
and to aduertise him, that there was a great fault in the archbishop and his fellowes.
In so much that Pandulph which was sent to him from the legat, declared in fauour of
the king, that there was not a more humble and modest prince to be found than king
John, and that the archbishop and his fellowes were too hard, and shewed themselues
too couetous in requiring the restitution that should be made to them for losses susteined
in time of the interdiction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discord betwixt
the cardinall
and the archbishop
of Canturburie.</div>

<p>Now the cause wherefore the legat and the king did send vnto the pope, was this.
There was some grudge betwixt the legat and the archbishop, for that where the pope
had written to the legat, how he should (according to the order of the ancient canons of
the church) place in euerie bishops s&eacute;e and abbeie (that was void) m&eacute;et and able persons
to rule and guide the same, the legat presuming on that authoritie granted him by
the pope, without the aduise of the archbishop or other bishops, tooke onelie with him
certeine of the kings chapleins, and comming with them to such churches as were vacant,
ordeined in them such persons as were nothing m&eacute;et to take such charge vpon them, and
that according to the old abuse of England, as Matthew Paris saith. Wherevpon the
archbishop of Canturburie repining at such dooings, sent to the legat as then being at
Burton vpon Trent, two of his chapleins from Dunstable (where he and his suffragans
held as then a synod, after the feast of the Epiphanie) commanding him by waie of appeale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
in no wise to meddle with instituting any gouernours to churches, within the precinct of
his iurisdiction, where such institutions belonged onelie to him.</p>

<p>Herevpon therefore the legat dispatched Pandulph to Rome vnto the pope as is aforesaid,
and the king likewise sent ambassadors thither, as the bishop of Norwich, and the
archdeacon of Northumberland, with others, the which in the end so behaued themselues
in their suit, that notwithstanding Simon Langton the archbishops brother earnestlie
withstood them, as proctor for the bishops, yet at length, the pope tooke order
in the matter, writing vnto his legat, that he should s&eacute;e the same fulfilled, and then absolue
the realme of the former interdiction. In this meane time, king John made prouision
to go ouer into France (as after y&eacute;e shall heare) but at his going ouer he committed
the whole ordering of this matter vnto the legat, and to William Marshall the
earle of Penbroke. The legat therefore vpon the receipt of the popes bulles, called a
councell at London, and there declaring what was conteined in the same, he tooke
bands for paiment of the residue of the fortie thousand marks which was behind, being
13000 onelie, as before I haue said.</p>

<p>About the same time also, Walter Gray bishop of Worcester was remooued to the
gouernement of the s&eacute;e of Yorke, which had b&eacute;ene vacant euer since the death of the archbishop
Geffrey. This Walter was the thr&eacute;e &amp; thirtith bishop that gouerned that s&eacute;e. But
now to returne and speake of the kings affaires in the parts beyond the sea. Ye shall
vnderstand, that hauing set his businesse in some good staie at home with the legat, he
applied his studie to the performance of his wars abroad, and therefore he first sent
monie into Flanders to paie the souldiers wages, which he had sent thither to aid the
erle there against king Philip. Which earle came ouer this yeare into England, and at
Canturburie the king receiued him where he did homage to the king for the whole earledome
of Flanders: and on the other part, the king as well to the said earle, as to such
lords and bishops which came ouer with him, declared his roiall liberalitie by princelie
gifts of gold, siluer, iewels, and pretious stones. After his returne, such capteins as
remained in his countrie with their bands at the king of Englands paie, made a iournie
into France, and wasted the lands that belonged to the earle of Guisnes, wanne the
castell of Bruncham, and raced it, taking within it diuerse men of armes and demilances.
They also wanne by siege the towne of Aire, and burnt it. The castell of Liens
they tooke by assault, and slue manie souldiers that defended it, beside those which they
tooke prisoners.</p>

<p>Moreouer, they wasted and destroied the lands which Lewes the French kings sonne
was possessed of in those parts. In the meane time, king John hauing prepared a
mightie nauie, and a strong armie of valiant soldiers, tooke sea at Portsmouth on
Candlemas day, with his wife, his sonne Richard, &amp; Elianor the sister of Arthur duke of
Britaine. He had not many of his earles or barons with him, but a great number of
knights and gentlemen, with whome he landed at Rochell in safetie, within a few daies
after his setting foorth. He tooke ouer with him inestimable treasure, as it was reported,
in gold, siluer, and iewels. Immediatlie vpon his arriuall at Rochell, the barons of
Poictow reuolted from the French king, and comming in to king John, did homage vnto
him, as to their king and souereigne lord.</p>

<p>But howsoeuer it was, after the truce began to expire which he had granted vnto the
earls of Marsh and Augi, on the friday before Whitsunday he came with his armie before
the castell of Meireuent, which belonged vnto Geffrey de Lucignam, and on the day next
insuing, being Whitsun &eacute;eue, he wanne the same. On Whitsunday he laid siege vnto
Nouant, an other castell belonging to the same Geffrey, who as then was lodged in the
same, and also two of his sonnes: but within thr&eacute;e daies after that the siege was laid,
the earle of Marsh came to king John, and did so much preuaile, that through his
means, both Geffrey and his two sonnes were receiued to mercie, and king John put in
possession of the castell. After this, bicause king John was aduertised, that Lewes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
French kings sonne had now besieged Mountcounter, a castell that was apperteining to
the said Geffrey, he hasted thitherwards, and came to Parthenay, whither came to him,
as well the foresaid earle of Marsh, as also the earle of Augi, and both they togither with
the said Geffrey de Lucignam, did homage to our king, and so became his liege men.
The same time also, the ladie Jane the kings daughter was affianced to the said earle of
Marsh his sonne, whereas the French king made means to haue hir married to his
sonne: but bicause king John doubted least that suit was attempted but vnder some
cloked pretense, he would giue no eare thereto, but rather made this match with the
earle of Marsh, in hope so to assure himselfe of the said earle, that he might stand him
in no small st&eacute;ed to defend his cause against his aduersaries of France. But now to the
doings in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The interdiction
released.</div>

<p>&para; Ye haue heard before how pope Innocent (or rather Nocent, who was the root of
much mischiefe and trouble, which qualities are nothing consonant to his name) according
to that king John had required of him by solemne messengers, directed his bulles
vnto his legat Nicholas, declaring vpon what conditions his pleasure was to haue the
sentence of interdiction released. Wherein first he commanded that the king should
satisfie and pay so much monie vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, and to the bishop
of London and Elie, as should fullie amount to the summe of 40 thousand markes (with
that which alreadie he had paied, which was 27 thousand markes, at two seueral paiments,
as vpon his accounts appeared.) For true contentation and paiment to be made
of the residue, he ordeined that the king should be sworne, and also seale to an obligation,
and certeine suerties with him (as the bishops of Norwich and Winchester, with the
earles of Chester, Winchester and Marshall) all which things were performed at this present,
so that after the assurance so taken for paiment of the od 13 thousand marks
behind, residue of the 40 thousand marks, the interdiction was taken vtterlie awaie, and
the land solemnelie released by the legat, sitting within the cathedrall church of S. Paule
at London, vpon the 29 of June, in the yeare 1214, after the terme of six yeares, thr&eacute;e
moneths, and 14 daies, that the realme had b&eacute;ene striken with that dreadfull dart of correction,
as it was then est&eacute;emed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emperor
Otho.</div>

<p>King John in the meane time remaining still in France, and finding at the beginning
fortune fauourable inough vnto him, by reason his power was much increased by the aid
of the Poictouins, determined to attempt the winning of Britaine, for this cause specialie,
that he might by so dooing weaken the French kings power, and partlie also to withdraw
him from the wars of Flanders, on which side he had procured likewise the French
borders to be inuaded with great force, and that not onelie by the earle and such capteins
as he had sent thither, and reteined in wages, but also by the emperour Otho, who in
proper person came downe into that countrie himselfe.</p>

<p>Herevpon king John went foorth with all his power of horssemen, and entering into
Britaine, made rodes through the countrie, wasting the same euen to the walles of
Naunts: but shortlie after the Britaines assembled togither, vnder the leading of Peter,
the son of Robert earle of Drieux (the French kings vncle, who had maried the ladie
Adela, daughter to duke Guie of Britaine) and marching foorth into the field to defend
their countrie from the enimies, came to ioine with them in battell. At the first there was a
verie sharp incounter, but at length the Britains being vanquished and put to flight, a
great number of them were taken prisoners, and amongst other their capteins, the foresaid
Peter was one, whom king John sent awaie with all the rest vnto Angiers, to be kept

<p>After this, he besieged a castell that stood vpon the banke of the riuer of Loir, called
La Roch au moyne, inforcing his whole indeuour to haue woone it. But yer he could
atteine his purpose, he was aduertised that Lewes the sonne of king Philip was comming
towards him with a great power to raise his siege. Wherefore hauing no great confidence
in the Poictouins, and vnderstanding that Lewes brought with him a verie strong armie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
he tooke aduise of his councell, who iudged that it should be best for him to breake vp
his siege and to depart, which he did, and went streight waies to Angiers. Lewes (after
king John was thus retired) brought the Poictouins againe to subiection, and put the
chief authours of the rebellion to death. In the meane time also his father king Philip
with like successe, but in a foughten field, vanquished the emperour Otho at the bridge
of Bouins on the 28 day of Julie, as in the historie of France more at large appeare.
There among other prisoners, the thr&eacute;e earles of Flanders, Salisburie, and Bullogne
were taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The saieng of
king John.</div>

<p>Now king John being aduertised of that ouerthrow, was maruellouslie sad and sorrowfull
for the chance, in so much that he would not receiue any meat in a whole daie after
the newes thereof was brought vnto him. At length turning his sorrow into rage, he
openlie said, that "since the time that he made himselfe &amp; his kingdom subiect to the
church of Rome, nothing that he did had prospered well with him." Ind&eacute;ed he condescended
to an agr&eacute;ement with the pope (as may be thought) more by force than of deuotion,
and therefore rather dissembled with the pope (sith he could not otherwise choose)
than agr&eacute;ed to the couenants with any hartie affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce taken

<p>But to the purpose. Perceiuing himself now destitute of his best fr&eacute;ends, of whom
diuerse remained prisoners with the French king (being taken at the battell of Bouins)
he thought good to agr&eacute;e with king Philip for this present, by way of taking some truce,
which by mediation of ambassadours riding to and fro betwixt them, was at length accorded
to endure for fiue yeares, and to begin at Easter in the yeare of our Lord, 1215.
After this, about the 19 daie of October he returned into England, to appease certeine
tumults which began alreadie to shoot out buds of some new ciuill dissention. And
suerlie the same spred abroad their blossoms so freshlie, that the fruit was knit before the
growth by anie timelie prouision could be hindered. For the people being set on by
diuerse of the superiours of both sorts, finding themselues gr&eacute;eued that the king kept not
promise in restoring the ancient lawes of S. Edward, determined from thencefoorth to vse
force, since by request he might not preuaile. To appease this furie of the people,
not onelie policie but power also was required, for the people vndertaking an euill
enterprise, speciallie raising a tumult or ioining in a conspiracie are as hardlie suppressed
and vanquished as Hydra the monster hauing manie heads: and therefore it is

<p>The Nobles supposing that longer delaie therein was not to be suffered, assembled themselues
togither at the abbeie of Burie (vnder colour of going thither to doo their deuotions
to the bodie of S. Edmund which laie there inshrined) where they vttered their complaint
of the kings tyrannicall maners, alledging how they were oftentimes called foorth
to serue in the wars &amp; to fight in defense of the realme, and yet notwithstanding were
still oppressed at home by the kings officers, who (vpon confidence of the lawes) attempted
all things whatsoeuer they conceiued. And if anie man complained, or alledged that
he receiued wrong at their hands, they would answer by and by, that they had law on
their side to doo as they had doone, so that it was no wrong but right which they did,
and therfore if they that were the lords and p&eacute;eres of the realme were men, it stood them
vpon to prouide that such inconueniencies might be auoided, and better lawes brought
in vse, by the which their ancestours liued in a more quiet and happie state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The charter of

<div class="sidenote">A firebrand of
dissention.</div>

<p>There was brought foorth and also read an ancient charter made sometime by
Henrie the first (which charter Stephan the archbishop of Canturburie had deliuered
vnto them before in the citie of London) conteining the grant of certeine liberties according
to the lawes of king Edward the confessor, profitable to the church and barons of the
realme, which they purposed to haue vniuersallie executed ouer all the land. And
therefore being thus assembled in the qu&eacute;ers of the church of S. Edmund, they receiued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
a solemne oth vpon the alter there, that if the king would not grant to the same liberties,
with others which he of his owne accord had promised to confirme to them, they would
from thencefoorth make warre vpon him, till they had obteined their purpose, and inforced
him to grant, not onelie to all these their petitions, but also y&eacute;eld to the confirmation
of them vnder his seale, for euer to remaine most stedfast and inuiolable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bernewell.</i></div>

<p>The ch&eacute;efe cause that mooued the lords to this conspiracie, rose by reason the king
demanded escuage of them that refused to go with him into Poictow: and they on the
other part mainteined, that they were not bound to paie it, for any warres which the king
made in the parts beyond the seas. But he to prooue that he ought to haue it declared how
in his fathers and brothers time it was paied, and therefore he ought to haue it. Much
adoo there was about this matter at the first broching thereof, and more adoo there had
b&eacute;ene, if the legats presence had not somewhat staied the parties. But after they had
gotten the charter of king Henrie the first at the hands of the archbishop of Canturburie,
they made such a sinister interpretation thereof, that supposing it to serue their turnes,
they proc&eacute;eded in their wilfull opinions (as aboue is mentioned.)</p>

<p>Finallie it was determined amongst them, that shortlie after Christmasse, they should
go to the king, and require of him that they might haue those laws restored, which he had
promised to them (as is aforesaid.) But forasmuch as they knew well that their sute
would not be thankfullie accepted, in the meane time they prouided themselues of horsse,
armour, and other furniture for the warre, thereby to be in the better readinesse and
safegard, if in exhibiting their request, the matter did grow to any such inforcement.
They appointed also diuerse of the most ancient lords to mooue the said matter to the
king, in all their names, who was as then at Worcester, and being aduertised of this conspiracie,
as soone as the feast of Christmasse was past, he went streight to London: thither
came the lords also with like sp&eacute;ed, leauing their men in the townes and villages abroad,
to be readie vpon any sudden warning to come vnto them, if n&eacute;ed should so require.</p>

<p>Being come into his presence, they required of him that it might please him, first, to
appoint the exercise and vse of those ancient lawes vnto them, by the which the kings of
England in times past ruled their subiects: secondlie, that according to his promise, he
would abrogate those newer lawes, which euerie man might with good cause name m&eacute;ere
wrongs, rather than lawes: and thirdlie they required of him the performance of all other
things, which he had most faithfullie of late vndertaken to obserue. The king (though
somewhat contrarie to his nature) hauing heard their request, gaue them a verie gentle
answer. For perceiuing them readie with force to constreine him, if by gentlenesse they
might not preuaile, he thought it should be more safe and easie for him to turne their
vnquiet minds with soft remedies than to go about to breake them of their willes by
strong hand, which is a thing verie dangerous, especiallie where both parts are of like
force. Therefore he promised them within a few daies, to haue consideration of their
request.</p>

(vnto whom he had giuen his daughter Elianor in marriage) to vndertake for him, and
as it were to become his suerties: which willinglie they did. Herewith the minds of the
Nobilitie being somewhat pacified, returned home to their houses. The king soon after
also, to assure himselfe the more effectuallie of the allegiance of his people in time to
come caused euerie man to renew his homage, and to take a new oth to be faithfull to
him against all other persons. And to prouide the more suerlie for himselfe, on Candlemasse
day next insuing, he tooke vpon him the crosse to go into the holie land, which I
thinke he did rather for feare than any deuotion, as was also thought by other, to the
end that he might (vnder the protection thereof) remaine the more out of danger of such
as were his foes. In which point of dissimulation he shewed himselfe prudent, observing

his cruell dealing, and also his accustomed adulterie with his brothers wife and others.
Other write that the same dissention rose by reason of the great crueltie, and vnreasonable
auarice, which the king vsed towards all the states and degr&eacute;es of his subiects, as
well towards them of the spiritualtie, as of the temporaltie. The prelats therefore of
the realme sore repining at his dooings, for that they could not patientlie suffer such exaction
to be leuied of their liuings (contrarie as they toke it to the libertie of the church)
found means through practise, to persuade both the kings of Scotland and France to aid

<p>Now therefore to the sequele of the matter. The king hauing sent awaie the barons
with a gentle answer, though he minded nothing less than to satisfie them in that they did
demand, bicause it made much against his roiall prerogatiue: and therewith fores&eacute;eing
that the matter would be like to grow at length to be tried by force, he began to dout his
owne estate, and therefore prepared an armie, and fortified diuerse castels and places with
men, munition, and vittels, into the which he might retire for his safetie in any time of
n&eacute;ed. The barons which vnderstood the kings diligence herein, and coniecturing thereof
his whole intent, made readie also their power, appointing for their generall one Robert
Fitz Walter, a man both excellent in counsell, and valiant in warre. Herewith they
came vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, presenting vnto him a booke, wherein was conteined
a note of all the articles of their petitions, &amp; required him to vnderstand the kings
mind touching the same. The archbishop coueting to extinguish the sedition (whereof
he himselfe had b&eacute;ene no small kindler) which was like to grow, if the Nobilitie were not
pacified the sooner, talked with the king, and exhorted his grace verie instantlie to satisfie
the requests of his barons, and herewith did shew the booke of the articles which they had
deliuered vnto him.</p>

<p>The king, when he saw what they demanded (which in effect was a new order in things
touching the whole state of the common-wealth) sware in a great furie, that he would
neuer condescend vnto those petitions. Whereof when the barons had knowledge, they
gat them strait vnto armour, making their assemblie at Stamford in the Easter w&eacute;eke,
whither they had drawne vnto them almost the whole Nobilitie, and gathered an exc&eacute;eding
great armie. For the commons flocked vnto them from euerie part, bicause the king

<p>The king as then was at Oxford, who hearing of the assemblie which the barons made,
and that they were come to Brakesley, on the mondaie next after the octaues of Easter,
he sent vnto them the archbishop of Canturburie, in whom he reposed great confidence,
and William Marshall earle of Penbroke, to vnderstand what they meant by that their assembling
thus togither. Wherevpon they deliuered to the same messengers a roll conteining
the ancient liberties, priuiledges and customs of the realme, signifieng that if the
king would not confirme the same, they would not cease to make him warre, till he should
satisfie their requests in that behalfe.</p>

<p>The archbishop and the earle returning to the king, shewed him the whole circumstance
of that which the barons demanded, who tooke great indignation thereat, and scornefullie
said; "Why do they not aske to haue the kingdome also?" Finallie, he affirmed with an
oth, "that he would neuer grant anie such liberties, whereby he should become a slaue."
Herevpon the archbishop and the earle of Penbroke returned to the barons, and declared
the kings deniall to confirme their articles. Then the barons naming their hoast The
armie of God and the holie church, set forward, and first came vnto Northampton, and
besieging the towne, when they could not preuaile, bicause the same was well prouided
for defense aforehand, they departed from thence, and came towards Bedford to besiege
the castell there, in which Sir William Beauchampe was capteine, who being secretlie
confederate with them deliuered the place incontinentlie into their hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bedford castell

<p>Whilest they remained here a certeine time to fortifie and furnish the castell with necessary

if they would send a conuenient power of souldiers to defend the citie, the same should
be receiued thereinto at some m&eacute;et and reasonable time in the night season by the
citizens, who would ioine with them in that quarell against the king to the vttermost of
their powers. The lords were glad of these newes, to haue the ch&eacute;efe citie of the realme
to take part with them, and therfore they sent foure bands of souldiers streightwaies
thither, which were brought into the citie in the night season (according to order aforehand
taken.) But as Matt. Paris saith, they were receiued into the citie by Algate,
the 24 of Maie being sundaie, whilest the citizens were at masse. The next day they
made open rebellion, tooke such as they knew fauoured the king, brake into the houses
of the Jewes, &amp; spoiled them.</p>

<p>The barons hauing thus gotten possession of the citie of London, wrote letters vnto all

they refused to aid them now in this necessitie, they would destroie their castels, manours,
parkes, and other possessions, making open warre vpon them as the enimies of God, and
rebels to the church. These were the names of those lords which yet had not sworne to
mainteine the foresaid liberties, William Marshall earle of Penbroke, Rainulfe earle of
Chester, Nicholas earle of Salisburie, William earle Warren, William erle of Albemarle,

<p>Also the pl&eacute;es in the eschequer ceased, and the shiriffes staied from executing their
office. For there was none that would paie anie monie to the kings vse, nor anie that
did obeie him, in somuch that there remained with him but onelie seuen horssemen of all
his traine at one time (as some write) though soone after he had a great power, which
came to him to the castell of Windsore, where he then laie, and meant to haue led the
same against the lords with all sp&eacute;ed. But hearing now of this new rebellion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Londoners, he changed his purpose and durst not depart from Windsore, being brought
in great doubt least all the other cities of the realme would follow their example. Herevpon
he thought good to assaie if he might come to some agr&eacute;ement by waie of communication,
and incontinentlie sent his ambassadours to the barons, promising them that he
would satisfie their requests, if they would come to Windsore to talke with him.</p>

<p>Howbeit, the lords hauing no confidence in his promise came with their armie within
thr&eacute;e miles of Windsore, and their pitcht downe their tents in a medow betwixt Stanes
and Windsore, whither king John also came the 15 daie of June, and shewed such
friendlie countenance towards euerie one of them, that they were put in good hope
he meant no deceipt. Being thus met, they fell in consultation about an agr&eacute;ement to be
had. On the kings part (as it were) sate the archbishops of Canturburie and Dublin,
the bishops of London, Winchester, Lincolne, Bath, Worcester, Couentrie, Rochester,
and Pandulph the popes Nuncio, with Almerike master of the knights templers: the
earles of Penbroke, Salisburie, Warren, Arundell, Alane de Galoway, William Fitz
Gerald, Peter Fitz Herbert, Alane Basset, Hugh de Neuill, Hubert de Burgh seneschall
of Poictou, Robert de Ropley, John Marshall and Philip de Albenie. On the barons
part, there were innumerable, for all the nobilitie of England was in a maner assembled
there togither.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magna Charta
and Charta de
Foresta.</div>

<p>Finallie, when the king measuring his owne strength with the barons, perceiued that he
was not able to resist them, he consented to subscribe and seale to such articles concerning
the liberties demanded, in forme for the most part as is conteined in the two charters
Magna Charta, and Charta de Foresta, beginning Iohannes Dei gratia, &amp;c. And he did
not onlie grant vnto them their petitions touching the forsaid liberties, but also to win
him further credit, was contented that they should choose out certeine graue and honourable
personages, which should haue authoritie and power to s&eacute;e those things performed
which he then granted vnto them.</p>

<p>There were twentie fiue of those that were so elected, namelie these. The earles of
Clare, Albemarle, Glocester, Winchester, and Hereford: also earle Roger, earle Robert,
earle Marshall the yoonger, Robert Fitz Walter the yoonger, Gilbert de Clare, Eustace
de Vescie, Hugh Bigot, William de Mowbray, the maior of London, Gilbert de la Vale,
Robert de Roos, John constable of Chester, Richard de Percie, John Fitz Robert, William
Mallet, Geffrey de Saie, Roger de Mowbray, William de Huntingfield, Richard de
Mountfichet, and William de Albenie. These fiue and twentie were sworne to s&eacute;e the
liberties granted and confirmed by the king to be in euerie point obserued, but if he went
against the same, then they should haue authoritie to compell him to the obseruing of
euerie of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The chatelains
of foure castels.</div>

<p>Moreouer, there were other that were sworne to be obedient, and as it were assistant
vnto these fiue and twentie p&eacute;eres in such things as they should appoint, which were these.
The earle of Arundell, the earle Warren by his attornie, Henrie Doilie, Hubert de

Henrie de Pont Audoin, Rafe de la Hay, Henrie de Brentfield, Warren Fitz Gerald,

William de Percie, William Agoilum, Engerand de Pratellis, William de Cirenton,
Roger de Zuche, Roger Fitz Barnard, and Godfrie de Grancombe. It was further ordered,
that the chatelains or constables (as I may call them) of the foure castels of Northampton,
Killingworth, Notingham, and Scarborow, should be sworne to the fiue and
twentie p&eacute;eres, to gouerne those castels in such wise as they should haue in commandement
from the said fiue and twentie p&eacute;eres, or from the greater part of them: and that such
should be placed as chatelains in the same, as were thought to be most true and faithfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
vnto the barons and the realme. &para; It was also decr&eacute;ed, that certeine strangers, as Flemings
and other, should be banished out of England.</p>

<p>The king herevpon sent his letters patents vnto the shiriffes of all the counties of this
realme, commanding them to s&eacute;e the ordinances and liberties which he granted and confirmed,
to be diligentlie obserued. And for the more strengthening of this his grant, he
had gotten the pope to confirme a like charter granted the yeare before. For the pope
(sith king John was become his obedient vassall, and the apostolike king) easilie granted
to gratifie both him and his lords herein, and so was the grant of the liberties corroborated
&amp; made good with a double confirmation, and so sealed, that it was impossible for
them to be separated in sunder, the kings grant being annexed to the popes bull.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rochester castell

<p>Immediatlie also vpon the confirmation now made by the king, diuerse lords came to
him, and required restitution of such possessions, lands, and houses, as he had in his
hands, the right whereof (as they alledged) apperteined to them: but he excused the
matter, and shifted them off, till by inquest taken, it might appeare what right euerie man
had to those things which they then claimed: and furthermore assigned them a daie to
be holden at Westminster, which was the sixt&eacute;enth day of Julie. But yer he restored at
that time the castell of Rochester vnto the archbishop of Canturburie, the barons hauing
obteined a great p&eacute;ece of their purpose (as they thought) returned to London with their
charter sealed, the date whereof was this: Giuen by our owne hand, in the medow called
Kuningsmede or Rimemede, betwixt Stanes and Windsore, the fift&eacute;enth of Iune, in

<div class="sidenote">The kings impatiencie
to s&eacute;e
himselfe brideled
by his subiects.</div>

<p>Great reioising was made for this conclusion of peace betwixt the king and his barons,
the people iudging that God had touched the kings heart, and mollified it, whereby
happie daies were come for the realme of England, as though it had b&eacute;ene deliuered out
of the bondage of Aegypt: but they were much deceiued, for the king hauing condescended
to make such grant of liberties, farre contrarie to his mind, was right sorowfull
in his heart, curssed his mother that bare him, the houre that he was borne, and the paps
that gaue him sucke, wishing that he had receiued death by violence of sword or knife, in
st&eacute;ed of naturall norishment: he whetted his t&eacute;eth, he did bite now on one staffe, and
now on an other as he walked, and oft brake the same in p&eacute;eces when he had doone, and
with such disordered behauiour and furious gestures he vttered his gr&eacute;efe, in such sort
that the Noble men verie well perceiued the inclination of his inward affection concerning
these things, before the breaking vp of the councell, and therefore sore lamented the
state of the realme, gessing what would follow of his impatiencie and displesant taking of
the matter.</p>

<p>Herevpon they said among themselues, "Wo be to vs, yea rather to the whole realme
that wanteth a sufficient king, and is gouerned by a tyrant that s&eacute;eketh the subuersion
therof. Now hath our souereigne lord made vs subiect to Rome, and to the Romish
court, so that we must hencefoorth obteine our protection from thence. It is verie much
to be feared, least we doo f&eacute;ele hereafter some further p&eacute;ece of misch&eacute;efe to light vpon vs
suddenlie. We neuer heard of any king that would not gladlie indeuor to withdraw his
necke from bondage &amp; captiuitie, but ours of his owne accord voluntarilie submitteth
himselfe to become vassall to euerie stranger." And thus the lords lamenting the case,
left the king, and returned to London (as before y&eacute;e haue heard.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">He sendeth ambassadors

<p>But the king disquieted not a little, for that he was thus driuen to y&eacute;eld so farre vnto
the barons, notwithstanding as much as was possible he kept his purpose secret, deuised
by what means he might disappoint all that had b&eacute;ene doone, and promised on his part,
at this assemblie betwixt him and the lords a pacification (as y&eacute;e haue heard.) Wherefore
the next day verie late in the euening, he secretlie departed to Southampton, and so
ouer into the Ile of Wight, where he tooke aduice with his councell what remedie he
might find to quiet the minds of his lords and barons, and to bring them vnto his
purpose. At length after much debating of the matter, it was concluded by the aduise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of the greater part, that the king should require the popes aid therein. And so Walter
the bishop of Worcester, &amp; John the bishop of Norwich, with one Richard Marish his
chancellor, with all sp&eacute;ed were sent as ambassadors from the king vnto pope Innocent, to
instruct him of the rebellion of the English Nobilitie, and that he constreined by force
had granted them certeine lawes and priuileges hurtfull to his realme, and preiudiciall to
his crowne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh de Boues.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>Moreouer, sith that all this was doone by the authoritie of the pope the king besought
him to make the same void, and to command the barons to obeie him being their king,
as reason required they should. There were also sent by him other messengers, as Hugh
de Boues and others, into diuerse parts beyond the sea, to bring from thence great numbers
of men of war and souldiers, appointing them to m&eacute;et him at Douer, at the feast
of saint Michaell next insuing. He sent likewise vnto all his chateleins and constables
of castels within the realme, requiring them to prouide themselues of all things necessarie
for defense of the holds committed to their charge, if they should chance to be besieged,
though it were on the next morrow.</p>

<p>His ambassadours and other messengers being thus dispatched, and hauing but few
persons left about him, or in maner none, except such of the bishop of Norwich his seruants
as he had borowed of him, he fell to take prises as any ships came by suspected not
to be his fr&eacute;ends, so s&eacute;eking to win the fauour of the mariners that belonged to the cinke
ports, and so lay close in the Ile of Wight and there about the sea-coasts for the space of
thr&eacute;e moneths togither. In which meane time, manie things were reported of him, some
calling him a fisher, some a merchant, and some a pirat and rouer. And manie (for that
no certeine newes could be heard of him) iudged that he was either drowned, or dead by
some other means. But he still looking for some power to come ouer to his aid, kept
himselfe out of the way, till the same should be arriued, and dissembled the conceit of his
reuenge and hart grudge, till opportunitie serued him with conuenient securitie to put
the same in execution. Wherein he shewed himselfe discr&eacute;et and prouident, and did as

<p>The lords all this while lay at London, and began to doubt the matter, bicause they
could heare no certeine newes where the king was become: for doubting (as I said) the
suertie of his person, he conueied himselfe secretlie from one place to another, lodging
and taking his diet oftentimes more meanlie than was decent for his estate: and still he
longed to heare how his ambassadours sped with the pope, who in the meane time comming
vnto Rome, and declaring their message at full, tooke it vpon their solemne oth, that
the right was on the kings side, and that the fault rested onelie on the lords, touching the
whole controuersie betw&eacute;ene them and him, who sought with great rigour and against reason
to bridle him at their pleasures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>They shewed also a note of certeine articles conteined in the charter, which s&eacute;emed to
make most for the kings purpose, and withall declared that the king in open assemblie,
where he and the barons met to talke of such matters, had protested that the kingdome of
England speciallie apperteined (as touching the souereingtie) vnto the church of Rome,
whervpon he neither could nor ought without knowledge of the pope to ordeine anie thing
anew, or change ought within that kingdome in preiudice thereof. Wherefore whereas
he put himselfe and all the rights of his kingdome by way of appealing vnder the protection
of the apostolike s&eacute;e: the barons yet without regard had to the same appeale, did
seize into their possession the citie of London, and getting them to armour, inforced the
king to confirme such vnreasonable articles, as there appeared for him to consider.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The popes

<p>The pope hauing heard their tale, and considered of the articles, with bending browes

barons of England doo go about to expell their king, which hath taken vpon him the
crosse, and is remaining vnder the protection of the apostolike s&eacute;e? And do they meane
ind&eacute;ed to translate the dominion that belongeth to the church of Rome vnto another?
By S. Peter we cannot suffer this iniurie to passe vnpunished." Herevpon (crediting the
ambassadours words) by the aduice of his cardinals, he d&eacute;cr&eacute;ed that all those priuiledges,
which the king had granted vnto the lords and barons of this realme, as inforced thereto
by their rebellious attempt, should be accounted void and of none effect. Also he wrote
vnto the lords, admonishing them by his letters that they should obeie their king, vpon
paine of his cursse if they should attempt anie thing that sounded to the contrarie.</p>

some are neuer wanting) which for monie passed not what he did to further anie mans

grieuouslie to be thus mocked, with great indignation both blamed king Johns vniust dealing,
and the popes wrongfull iudgement, in that he had pronounced against them, without
hearing what they had of right to alledge for themselues. Wherevpon out of hand (notwithstanding

pope, to aduertise him of their disobedience and great contumacie shewed in refusing to
stand to his prescript. This doone, he returned to the Ile of Wight, and sailed from
thence to Douer, where diuerse of those his commissaries which he had sent to hire soldiers
in forren parts returned to him, bringing with them out of diuerse countries such a
multitude of souldiers and armed men, that the onelie sight of them stroke the harts of all
the beholders with great feare and terror. For out of the parties of Poictou and Gascoine,
there came men of great nobilitie, and right worthie warriours, as Sauerie de Mauleon,
Geffrey and Oliuer de Buteuile two brethren, hauing vnder them great numbers of good
souldiers and tall men of warre. Also out of Brabant there came Walter Buc, Gerard de
Sotignie, and one Godestall, with thr&eacute;e legions of armed men and crossebowes. Likewise
there came out of Flanders other capteins, with diuerse bands of souldiers, which Ferdinando
earle of Flanders (latelie returned out of the French captiuitie) for old fr&eacute;endships
sake furnished and sent ouer to aid him against his subiects, according as he had
requested.</p>

<p>King John then hauing recouered strength about him, and being aduertised that William
de Albenie was entred into the castell of Rochester with a great number of knights,
men of armes and other souldiers, hasted thither with his whole armie, and besieged them
within, inforcing himselfe by all waies possible to win the castell as well by battering the
walles with engines, as by giuing thereto manie assaults: but the garison within (consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
of nintie and foure knights beside demilances, and other souldiers) defended the place
verie manfullie, in hope of rescue from the barons, which laie as then at London: but they
comming forward one daies iournie vnto Dartford, when they heard that the king was
comming forward in good araie of battell to m&eacute;et them, vpon consideration had of their
owne forces, for that they were not able to match him with footmen, they returned backe
againe to the citie, breaking that assured promise which they had made and also confirmed
by their solemne oths, which was that if the castell should chance to be besieged, they
would not faile but raise the siege.</p>

<p>At length they within for want of vittels were constreined to y&eacute;eld it vp vnto the king,
after it had b&eacute;ene besieged the space of thr&eacute;e score daies: during which time they had
beaten backe their enimies at sundry assaults, with great slaughter and losse. But the
king hauing now got the possession of that hold, vpon gr&eacute;efe conceiued for the losse of so
manie men, and also bicause he had line so long about it yer he could winne it, to his
inestimable costs and charges, was determined to haue put them all to death that had kept
it. But Sauerie de Mauleon aduised him otherwise, lest by such crueltie, the barons in
any like case should be occasioned to vse the same extremitie towards such of his people,
as by chance might fall into their hands. Thus the king spared the Nobles and gentlemen,
sending William de Albenie, William de Lancaster, William de Emeford, Thomas de
Muleton, Osbert Gifford, Osbert de Bobie, Odinell de Albenie, and diuerse other to the
castell of Corfe, there to be kept as prisoners. But Robert Charnie, Richard Gifford,
and Thomas de Lincolne were sent to Notingham, and so other were sent to other places.
As for all the demilances or yeomen (if I shall so call them) and the arcubalisters which
had slaine manie of his men during the siege (as Matthew Paris saith) the king caused
them to be hanged, to put other in feare that should so obstinatlie resist him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bernewell.</i></div>

<p>Neuerthelesse (as the booke that belonged to Bernewell abbie saith) there was not any
of them hanged, sauing one arcubalister onelie, whome the king had brought vp of a child.
But howsoeuer the king dealt with them after they were y&eacute;elded, true it is (as by the same
booke it appeareth) there had b&eacute;ene no siege in those daies more earnestlie inforced, nor
more obstinatlie defended: for after that all the limmes of the castell had b&eacute;ene reuersed
and throwne downe, they kept the maister tower, till halfe thereof was also ouerthrowne,
and after kept the other halfe, till through famine they were constreined to y&eacute;eld, hauing
nothing but horsseflesh and water to susteine their liues withall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hugh de Boues
drowned.</div>

<p>Here is to be remembred, that whilest the siege laie thus at Rochester, Hugh de Boues
a valiant knight, but full of pride and arrogancie, a Frenchman borne, but banished out
of his countrie, came downe to Calice with an huge number of men of warre and souldiers
to come to the aid of king John. But as he was vpon the sea with all his people, meaning
to land at Douer, by a sudden tempest which rose at that instant, the said Hugh with all
his companie was drowned by shipwracke. Soone after the bodie of the same Hugh with
the carcases of other innumerable, both of men, women, and children, were found not
farre from Yermouth, and all along that coast. There were of them in all fortie thousand,
as saith Matthew Paris, for of all those which he brought with him, there was (as it
is said) not one man left aliue.</p>

<p>The king (as the fame went, but how true I know not) had giuen by charter vnto the
said Hugh de Boues, the whole countrie of Northfolke, so that he ment to haue expelled
the old inhabitants, and to haue peopled it with strangers. But whether this was so or not,
sure it is that he was verie sorowfull for the losse of this succor and aid which thus perished
in the seas, though it happened verie well for his subiects of England, that should
haue b&eacute;ene sore oppressed by such multitude of strangers, which for the most part must
n&eacute;eds haue liued vpon the countrie, to the vtter vndooing of the inhabitants wheresoeuer
they should haue come.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rafe Cog.</i></div>

<p>H&eacute;ere is to be noted, that during the siege of Rochester (as some write) there came out
of France to the number n&eacute;ere hand of seauen thousand men sent from the French king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
vnto the aid of the barons, at the suit of Saer de Quincie earle of Winchester and other
ambassadours that were sent from the barons, during the time of this siege, although it
should s&eacute;eme by Matthew Paris, that the said earle was not sent till after the pope had
excommunicated the barons (as after y&eacute;e shall heare.) The Frenchmen that came ouer
at this first time landed at Orwell, and at other hauens there n&eacute;ere adioining.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Walter Graie

<p>About this season, the canons of Yorke (bicause the archbishops s&eacute;e there had remained
void a long time) obtaining licence of the king, assembled togither about the election of
an archbishop. And though the king had once againe earnestlie mooued them to preferre
Walter Graie bishop of Worcester, yet they refused so to doo, and therefore chose Simon
de Langton, brother to the archbishop of Canturburie, which election was afterward made
void by the earnest trauell of the king to the pope, bicause his brother the said archbishop
of Canturburie was known to fauour the part of the barons against him, so that the said
Walter Graie was then elected and promoted to the guiding of the s&eacute;e of Yorke, according
to the kings speciall desire in that behalfe.</p>

<p>About the same time also, pope Innocent being certified, how the barons of England
would not obeie his prescript, iudged them enimies to the church and gaue commandement
to Peter the bishop of Winchester, to the abbat of Reading, and to the subdeacon Pandulph,
to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against them. But they could not
at the first execute the popes commandement herein, by reason that the archbishop of
Canturburie, who fauoured the barons cause, would not permit them. Wherefore the
same archbishop was interdicted out of the church, and from saieng diuine seruice, and
also being cited to appeare at Rome, was in danger to be depriued of his miter: had not
certeine cardinals intreated for him, and obteined his pardon. The archbishop being
gone to Rome, as well to excuse himselfe in this matter, as to be present at the generall
councell there holden at that time (for he was readie to go take the sea thitherwards when
the bishop of Winchester and Pandulph came to him with the popes letters) the said
bishop of Winchester &amp; Pandulph proc&eacute;eded to the pronouncing of the excommunication
against the barons, renewing the same euerie sundaie and holieday: albeit the barons
(bicause none of them were expresselie named in the popes letters) made none account of

the residue of the armie, and passing through the counties of Essex, and Hertford, Middlesex,

and went backe towards S. Edmundsburie.</p>

<p>In the meane while, the K. being gone (as y&eacute;e haue heard) to the borders of Scotland,
a brute was raised that he was dead, and secretlie buried at Reading. But this rumour
had not time to worke any great alteration, for after he had dispatched his businesse in

the midst of Lent himselfe in person besieged the castell of Colchester, and within a few
daies after his comming thither, it was deliuered vnto him by Frenchmen that kept it,
with condition that they might depart with all their goods and armour, vnto their fellowes

<p>whereas by meanes of defects in the contrarie, he bare too low a saile, in that he would
be so foolified as being a king, to suffer vsurped supremasie to be caruer of his kingdome.
But let vs s&eacute;e the consequence. The pope desirous to helpe king John all that he might
(bicause he was now his vassall) sent his legat Gualo into France, to disswade king Philip
from taking anie enterprise in hand against the king of England. But king Philip though
he was content to heare what the legat could saie, yet by no meanes would be turned from
the execution of his purpose, alledging that king John was not the lawfull king of England,
hauing first vsurped and taken it awaie from his nephue Arthur the lawfull inheritour,
and that now sithens as an enimie to his owne roiall dignitie he had giuen the right of
his kingdome awaie to the pope (which he could not doo without consent of his nobles)
and therefore through his owne fault he was worthilie depriued of all his kinglie honor.
For the kingdome of England (saith he) neuer belonged to the patrimonie of S. Peter,
nor at anie time shall. For admit that he were rightfull king, yet neither he nor anie
other prince may giue awaie his kingdome without the assent of his barons, which are
bound to defend the same, and the prerogatiue roiall, to the vttermost of their powers.
Furthermore (saith he) if the pope doo meane to mainteine this errour, he shall giue a
perilous example to all kingdomes of the world. Herewithall the Nobles of France then
present, protested also with one voice, that in defense of this article they would stand to
the death, which is, that no king or prince at his will and pleasure might giue awaie his
kingdome, or make it tributarie to anie other potentate, whereby the Nobles should become
thrall or subject to a forren gouernour. These things were doone at Lions in the

<p>Lewes on the morrow following, being the 26 of Aprill, by his fathers procurement,
came into the councell chamber, and with frowning looke beheld the legat, where by his
procurator he defended the cause that moued him to take vpon him this iournie into England,
disprouing not onelie the right which king John had to the crowne, but also alledging
his owne interest, not onelie by his new election of the barons, but also in the title of
his wife, whose mother the qu&eacute;ene of Castile remained onelie aliue of all the brethren
and sisters of Henrie the second late king of England (as before ye haue heard.) The
legat made answer herevnto, that "king John had taken vpon him the crosse, as one appointed
to go to warre against Gods enimies in the holie land, wherefore he ought by
decr&eacute;e of the generall councell to haue peace for foure yeares to come, and to remaine in
suertie vnder protection of the apostolike s&eacute;e." But Lewes replied thereto, that king
John had by warre first inuaded his castels and lands in Picardie, and wasted the same,
as Buncham castell and Liens, with the countie of Guisnes which belonged to the f&eacute;e of
the said Lewes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matt. Paris.</i></div>

<p>But these reasons notwithstanding, the legat warned the French king on paine of
cursing, not to suffer his sonne to go into England, and likewise his sonne, that he should
not presume to take the iournie in hand. But Lewes hearing this, declared that his
father had nothing to do to forbid him to prosecute his right in the realme of England,
which was not holden of him, and therefore required his father not to hinder his purpose
in such things as belonged nothing to him, but rather to licence him to s&eacute;eke the recouerie
of his wiues right, which he meant to pursue with perill of life, if n&eacute;ed should
require.</p>

<p>The legat perceiuing he could not preuaile in his sute made to king Philip, thought
that he would not spend time longer in vaine, in further treating with him, but sped him
foorth into England, obteining yet a safeconduct of the French king to passe through his
realme. Lewes in like maner, purposing by all meanes to preuent the legat, first dispatched
foorth ambassadours in all hast vnto the court of Rome to excuse himselfe to
the pope, and to render the reasons that most speciallie mooued him to proc&eacute;ed forward
in his enterprise against king John, being called by the barons of England to take the
crowne thereof vpon him. This doone, with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed he came downe to

<p>Lewes therefore foorthwith imbarking himselfe with his people, and all necessarie prouisions
for such a iournie, tooke the sea, and arriued at a place called Stanchorre in the
Ile of Tenet, vpon the 21 day of Maie, and shortlie after came to Sandwich, &amp; there
landed with all his people, where he also incamped vpon the shore by the space of thr&eacute;e
daies. In which meane time there came vnto him a great number of those lords and
gentlemen which had sent for him, and there euerie one apart and by himselfe sware
fealtie and homage vnto him, as if he had b&eacute;ene their true and naturall prince.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>King John about the same time that Lewes thus arriued, came to Douer, meaning to
fight with his aduersaries by the way as they should come forward towards London. But yet
vpon other aduisement taken, he changed his purpose, bicause he put some doubt in the
Flemings and other strangers, of whome the most part of his armie consisted, bicause he
knew that they hated the French men no more than they did the English. Therefore furnishing
the castell of Douer, with men, munition, and vittels, he left it in the k&eacute;eping of
Hubert de Burgh, a man of notable prowesse &amp; valiancie, and returned himselfe vnto
Canturburie, and from thence tooke the high waie towards Winchester. Lewes being
aduertised that king John was retired out of Kent, passed through the countrie without
anie incounter, and wan all the castels and holds as he went, but Douer he could not win.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rochester

<p>At his comming to Rochester, he laid siege to the castell there, and wan it, causing all
the strangers that were found within it to be hanged. This doone, he came to London,
and there receiued the homage of those lords and gentlemen which had not yet doone
their homage to him at Sandwich. On the other part he tooke an oth to mainteine and
performe the old lawes and customes of the realme, and to restore to euerie man his
rightfull heritage and lands, requiring the barons furthermore to continue faithfull towards
him, assuring them to bring things so to passe, that the realme of England should
recouer the former dignitie, and they their ancient liberties. Moreouer he vsed them so
courteouslie, gaue them so faire words, and made such large promises, that they bel&eacute;eued
him with all their harts. But alas! Cur vincit opinio verum?</p>

<p>The rumour of this pretended outward courtesie being once spred through the realme,
caused great numbers of people to come flocking to him, among whome were diuerse of
those which before had taken part with king John, as William earle Warren, William earle
of Arundell, William earle of Salisburie, William Marshall the yoonger, and diuerse
other, supposing verelie that the French kings sonne should now obteine the kingdome,
who in the meane time ordeined Simon Langton afore mentioned, to be his chancellour,
by whose preaching and exhortation, as well the citizens of London as the barons that
were excommunicated, caused diuine seruice to be celebrated in their presence, induced
thereto, bicause Lewes had alreadie sent his procurators to Rome before his comming
into England, there to shew the goodnesse of his cause and quarell.</p>

<p>But this auailed them not, neither tooke his excuse any such effect as he did hope it

assertions, so that there was hard hold about it in that court, albeit that the pope would
decr&eacute;e nothing till he hard further from his legat Gualo, who the same time (being aduer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>tised
of the proc&eacute;edings of Lewes in his iournie) with all diligence hasted ouer into
England, and passing through the middle of his aduersaries, came vnto king John, then
soiourning at Glocester, of whome he was most ioifullie receiued, for in him king John
reposed all his hope of victorie. This legat immediatlie after his comming did excommunicate
Lewes by name, with all his fautors and complices, but speciallie Simon de Langton,
with bell, booke, and candle, as the maner was. Howbeit the same Simon, and one
Geruase de Hobrug deane of S. Pauls in London, with other, alledged that for the right
and state of the cause of Lewes, they had alreadie appealed to the court of Rome, and
therefore the sentence published by Gualo they tooke as void.</p>

<p>At the same time also, all the knights and men of warre of Flanders and other parts beyond
the seas, which had serued the king, departed from him, the Poictouins onelie excepted:
and part of them that thus went from him resorted vnto Lewes, and entred into
his wages; but the residue repaired home into their own countries, so that Lewes being
thus increased in power, departed from London, and marching towards Winchester, he
wan the castels of Rigat, Gilford, and Farnham. From thence he went to Winchester,
where the citie was y&eacute;elded vnto him, with all the castels and holds thereabout, as Woluesey,

de Collingham, being of a valorous mind, and loathing forren subiection, who would in no
wise doo fealtie to Lewes, but assembling togither about the number of a thousand archers,
kept himselfe within the woods and desert places, whereof that countrie is full, and so

<p>In like manner, all the fortresses, townes, and castels in the south parts of the realme
were subdued vnto the obeisance of Lewes (the castels of Douer and Windsore onelie
excepted.) Within a little while after, Will. de Mandeuille, Robert Fitz Walter, and
William de Huntingfield, with a great power of men of warre, did the like vnto the countries
of Essex and Suffolke. In which season, king John fortified the castels of Wallingford,
Corfe, Warham, Bristow, the Vies, and diuerse others with munition and vittels.
About which time letters came also vnto Lewes from his procurators, whom he had sent
to the pope, by the tenor whereof he was aduertised, that notwithstanding all that they
could doo or say, the pope meant to excommunicate him, and did but onelie staie till he
had receiued some aduertisement from his legat Gualo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The points
wherewith king
John was
charged.</div>

<p>The ch&eacute;efest points (as we find) that were laid by Lewes his procurators against king
John were these, that by the murther committed in the person of his nephue Arthur, he
had b&eacute;ene condemned in the parlement chamber, before the French king, by the p&eacute;eres of
France, and that being summoned to appeare, he had obstinatelie refused so to doo, and
therefore had by good right forfeited not onelie his lands within the precinct of France,
but also the realme of England, which was now due vnto the said Lewes as they alledged,
in right of the ladie Blanch his wife, daughter to Elianor qu&eacute;ene of Spaine. But the pope
refelled all such allegations as they produced for proofe hereof, &amp; s&eacute;emed to defend king
Johns cause verie pithilie: but namelie, in that he was vnder the protection of him as
supreme lord of England: againe, for that he had taken vpon him the crosse (as before
y&eacute;e haue heard.) But now to returne where we left.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Frenchmen

<p>About the feast of saint Margaret, Lewes with the lords came againe to London, at
whose comming, the tower of London was y&eacute;elded vp to him by appointment, after which
the French capteins and gentlemen, thinking themselues assured of the realme, began to

<p>they did manie excessiue outrages, in spoiling and robbing the people of the countrie,
without pitie or mercie. Moreouer they did not onelie breake into mens houses, but also
into churches, and tooke out of the same such vessels and ornaments of gold and siluer,
as they could laie hands vpon: for Lewes had not the power now to rule the gr&eacute;edie souldiers,

<p>But most of all their tyrannie did appeare in the east parts of the realme, when they
went through the countries of Essex, Suffolke and Northfolke, where they miserablie
spoiled the townes and villages, reducing those quarters vnder their subiection, and making
them tributaries, vnto Lewes in most seruile and slauish manner. Furthermore, at his
comming to Norwich, he found the castell void of defense, and so tooke it, without any
resistance, and put into it a garison of his souldiers. Also he sent a power to the towne
of Lin, which conquered the same, and tooke the citizens prisoners, causing them to paie
great summes of monie for their ransoms. Morouer, Thomas de Burgh, chateleine of the
castell of Norwich, who vpon the approch of the Frenchmen to the citie, fled out in hope
to escape, was taken prisoner, and put vnder safek&eacute;eping. He was brother vnto Hubert

then, togither with Robert de Ropeley, comming into that countrie, tooke the citie of
Lincolne, and brought all the countrie vnder subiection (the castell onlie excepted.) After
that, they inuaded Holland, and spoiling that countrie, made it also tributarie vnto the

<p>In the meane time, Lewes was brought into some good hope thorough meanes of
Thomas de Burgh, whom he tooke prisoner (as before you haue heard) to persuade his
brother Hubert to y&eacute;eld vp the castell of Douer, the siege whereof was the next enterprise
which he attempted. For his father king Philip, hearing that the same was kept by
a garrison, to the behoofe of king John, wrote to his sonne, blaming him that he left
behind him so strong a fortresss in his enimies hands. But though Lewes inforced his
whole endeuour to win that castell, yet all his trauell was in vaine. For the said Hubert
de Burgh, and Gerard de Sotigam, who were ch&eacute;efe capteins within, did their best to
defend it against him and all his power, so that despairing to win it by force, he assaied
to obteine his purpose, by threatening to hange the capteins brother before his face, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
would not y&eacute;eld the sooner. But when that would not serue, he sought to win him by
large offers of gold and siluer. Howbeit, such was the singular constancie of Hubert,
that he would not giue anie eare vnto those his flatering motions. Then Lewes in a great
furie menaced that he would not once depart from thence, till he had woon the castell,
and put all them within to death, and began to assaile it with more force than before he

them great summes of monie by waie of ransoming. And at length returning by Colchester,
they vsed like practises there. From thence they returned to London, and shortlie

your heads. For this vnderstand, that Lewes, and with him 16 earles and barons of
France, haue secretlie sworne (if it shall fortune him to conquere this realme of England,

of his aduersaries.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Northfolke and

<p>King John lieng all this while at Winchester, and hauing knowledge how his aduersaries
were dailie occupied in most hard enterprises, as in besieging sundrie strong and
inuincible places, sent forth his commissioners to assemble men of warre, and to allure
vnto his seruice all such, as in hope of prey, were minded to follow his standard, of the
which there resorted to him no small number. So that hauing gotten togither a competent
armie for his purpose, he brake foorth of Winchester, as it had b&eacute;ene an hideous
tempest of weather, beating downe all things that stood in his waie, sending foorth his
people on ech side to wast the countries, to burne vp the townes and villages, to spoile
the churches &amp; churchmen. With which successe still increasing his furie, he turned his
whole violence into Cambridgeshire, where he did exc&eacute;eding great hurt. Then entring
into the countries of Northfolke and Suffolke, he committed the like rage, wast, and
destruction, in the lands and possessions that belonged vnto the earle of Arundell, to
Roger Bigot, William de Huntingfield, and Roger de Cressey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The siege raised
from Windsor.</div>

<p>The barons in the meane time that lay at siege before the castle of Windsore, hearing
that hauocke which king John had made in the east parts of the realme, secretlie in the
night season raised their camps, and leauing their tents behind them, with all sp&eacute;ed made
towards Cambridge. But king John by faithfull espials, hauing aduertisement of their
intent, which was, to get betwixt him and the places of his refuge, withdrew him and got to
Stamford, yer they might reach to Cambridge, so that missing their purpose, after they
had taken some spoiles abroad in the countrie, they returned to London. King John
from Stamford, marched toward Lincolne, bicause he heard that the castell there was
besieged.</p>

<p>But those that had besieged it, as Gilbert de Gaunt, and others, hearing that king John
was comming towards them, durst not abide him, but fled, and so escaped. The king
then turned his iournie towards the marshes of Wales, and there did much hurt to those
places that belonged to his aduersaries. After this also, and with a verie puissant armie
he went eftsoones eastwards, and passing through the countries, came againe into the counties
of Northfolke and Suffolke, wasting and afflicting all that came in his waie, and at
length comming to Lin, was there ioifullie receiued. Then k&eacute;eping foorth northwards,
he spoiled the townes and abbeies of Peterburgh and Crowland, where a number of the
kings enimies were withdrawne into the church, but Sauerie de Mauleon, being sent foorth
to s&eacute;eke them, found them in the church the morrow after S. Michaell, and drew them
out by force, spoiled the house, and getting a great bootie and prey of cattell and other
riches, he with his people conueied the same awaie at his departing, after he had ransacked
euerie corner of the church, and other the houses and places belonging to that
abbeie.</p>

<p>Thus the countrie being wasted on each hand, the king hasted forward till he came to
Wellestreme sands, where passing the washes he lost a great part of his armie, with horsses
and carriages, so that it was iudged to be a punishment appointed by God, that the spoile
which had b&eacute;ene gotten and taken out of churches, abbeies, and other religious houses,
should perish, and be lost by such means togither with the spoilers. Yet the king himselfe,
and a few other, escaped the violence of the waters, by following a good guide.
But as some haue written, he tooke such gr&eacute;efe for the losse susteined in this passage, that
immediatlie therevpon he fell into an ague, the force and heat whereof, togither with his
immoderate f&eacute;eding on rawe peaches, and drinking of new sider, so increased his sicknesse,
that he was not able to ride, but was faine to be carried in a litter presentlie made
of twigs, with a couch of strawe vnder him, without any bed or pillow, thinking to haue
gone to Lincolne, but the disease still so raged and grew vpon him, that he was inforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
to staie one night at the castell of Laford, and on the next day with great paine, caused
himselfe to be caried vnto Newarke, where in the castell through anguish of mind, rather
than through force of sicknesse, he departed this life the night before the ninet&eacute;enth day
of October, in the yeare of his age fiftie and one, and after he had reigned seauent&eacute;ene
yeares, six moneths, and seauen and twentie daies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>&para; There be which haue written, that after he had lost his armie, he came to the abbeie
of Swineshead in Lincolnshire, and there vnderstanding the cheapenesse and plentie of
corne, shewed himselfe greatlie displeased therewith, as he that for the hatred which
he bare to the English people, that had so traitorouslie reuolted from him vnto his aduersarie
Lewes, wished all miserie to light vpon them, and therevpon said in his anger,
that he would cause all kind of graine to be at a farre higher price, yer manie daies
should passe. Wherevpon a moonke that heard him speake such words, being mooued
with zeale for the oppression of his countrie, gaue the king poison in a cup of ale, whereof
he first tooke the assaie, to cause the king not to suspect the matter, and so they both
died in manner at one time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gisburn &amp; alij.</i></div>

<p>There are that write, how one of his owne seruants did conspire with a conuert of that
abbeie, and that they prepared a dish of peares, which they poisoned, thr&eacute;e of the whole
number excepted, which dish the said conuert presented vnto him. And when the king
suspected them to be poisoned ind&eacute;ed, by reason that such pretious stones as he had
about him, cast foorth a certeine sweat, as it were bewraieng the poison, he compelled
the said conuert to tast and eat some of them, who knowing the thr&eacute;e peares which were
not poisoned, tooke and eat those thr&eacute;e, which when the king had s&eacute;ene, he could no
longer absteine, but fell to, and eating gr&eacute;edilie of the rest, died the same night, no hurt
happening to the conuert, who thorough helpe of such as bare no good will to the K.
found shift to escape, and conueied himselfe awaie from danger of receiuing due punishment
for so wicked a d&eacute;ed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The variable
reports of
writers, concerning
the
death of king
John.</div>

<p>Beside these reports which y&eacute;e haue heard, there are other that write, how he died of
surfeting in the night, as Rafe Niger; some, of a bloudie flux, as one saith that writeth
an addition vnto Roger Houeden. And Rafe Cogheshall saith, that comming to Lin,
(where he appointed Sauerie de Mauleon to be capteine, and to take order for the fortifieng
of that towne) he tooke a surfet there of immoderat diet, and withall fell into a
laske, and after his laske had left him, at his comming to Laford in Lindsey, he was
let bloud: furthermore to increase his other gr&eacute;efes and sorrowes for the losse of his
carriage, iewels and men, in passing ouer the washes, which troubled him sore; there
came vnto him messengers from Hubert de Burgh, and Gerard de Sotegam capteins of
Douer castell, aduertising him, that they were not able to resist the forceable assaults and
engins of the enimies, if sp&eacute;edie succour came not to them in due time. Whereat
his gr&eacute;efe of mind being doubled, so as he might s&eacute;eme euen oppressed with sorrow, the
same increased his disease so vehementlie, that within a small time it made an end of his
life (as before y&eacute;e haue heard.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bernewell.</i></div>

<p>The men of warre that serued vnder his ensignes, being for the more part hired souldiers
and strangers, came togither, and marching foorth with his bodie, each man with
his armour on his backe, in warlike order, conueied it vnto Worcester, where he was
pompouslie buried in the cathedrall church before the high altar, not for that he had so
appointed (as some write) but bicause it was thought to be a place of most suertie for
the lords and other of his fr&eacute;ends there to assemble, and to take order in their businesse
now after his deceasse. And bicause he was somewhat fat and corpulent, his bowels
were taken out of his bodie, and buried at Croxton abbeie, a house of moonks of the
order called Pr&aelig;monstratenses, in Staffordshire, the abbat of which house was his physician.</p>

<p>&para; How soeuer or where soeuer or when soeuer he died, it is not a matter of such moment
that it should impeach the credit of the storie; but certeine it is that he came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
his end, let it be by a surfet, or by other meanes ordeined for the shortening of his life.
The manner is not so materiall as the truth is certeine. And suerlie, he might be thought
to haue procured against himselfe manie molestations, manie anguishes &amp; vexations,
which nipt his hart &amp; gnawd his very bowels with manie a sore symptome or passion;
all which he might haue withstood if fortune had b&eacute;ene so fauourable, that the loialtie of
his subiects had remained towards him inuiolable, that his Nobles with multitudes of
adherents had not with such shamefull apostasie withstood him in open fight, that forren
force had not weakened his dominion, or rather robbed him of a maine branch of his
regiment, that he himselfe had not sought with the spoile of his owne people to please
the imaginations of his ill affected mind; that courtiers &amp; commoners had with one assent
performed in dutie no lesse than they pretended in veritie, to the preseruation of the state
and the securitie of their souereigne: all which presupposed plagues concurring, what
happinesse could the king arrogate to himselfe by his imperiall title, which was through
his owne default so imbezelled, that a small remanent became his in right, when by open
hostilitie and accurssed papasie the greater portion was pluckt out of his hands.</p>

<p>Here therefore we s&eacute;e the issue of domesticall or homebred broiles, the fruits of variance,
the game that riseth of dissention, whereas no greater nor safer fortification can
betide a land, than when the inhabitants are all alike minded. By concord manie an
hard enterprise (in common sense thought vnpossible) is atchieued, manie weake things
become so defended, that without manifold force they cannot be dissolued. From diuision
and mutinies doo issue (as out of the Troiane horsse) ruines of roialties, and decaies
of communalties. The sinewes of a realme is supposed of some to be substance
and wealth; of other some policie and power: of other some conuenient defenses both
by water and land: but a most excellent description of a well fortified countrie is that of
Plautus, set downe in most pithie words and graue sentences: no lesse worthie to be
written than read and considered. The description is this.</p>

<p>And therefore no maruell though both courtiers and commoners fell from king John their
naturall prince, and tooke part with the enimie; not onelie to the disgrace of their souereigne,
but euen to his ouerthrow, and the depopulation of the whole land; sith these
maine bulworks and rampiers were wanting; and the contrarie in most ranke sort and
detestable manner extended their virulent forces.</p>

<p>But we will surceasse to aggrauate this matter, sith the same is sufficientlie vrged in
the verie course of the historie concerning his acts and d&eacute;eds, continued to the verie
day of his death, and the verie time of his buriall, whereof I saie thus much, that whether
it was his will to be interred, as is aforesaid, or whether his corpse being at the disposing
of the suruiuers, to elect the place as a conuenient storehouse for a princes bones, I leaue
it as doubtfull, and therefore vndetermined, est&eacute;eming the lesse to labour therein, bicause
the truth can hardlie by certeintie be winnowed out, but by coniecturall supposals
aimed and shot at. Notwithstanding, in my poore iudgement it is verie likelie (first
in respect of the time which was superstitious and popish; secondlie by reason of the
custome of funerall rites then commonlie vsed) that he was buried in the said place for
order sake, &amp; his bodie (if I may presume so farre by warrant of mine author) wrapped
in a moonks cowle and so laid in his graue or toome. For the manner was at that time,
in such sort to burie their Nobles and great men, who were induced by the imaginations
of moonks and fond fansies of fr&eacute;ers to bel&eacute;eue, that the said cowle was an amulet or
defensitiue to their soules from hell and hellish hags, how or in what soeuer sort they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
died; either in sorrow and repentance for sinne, or in blasphemie, outrage, impatiencie,

<p>This forme of funerals was frequented in Wales, hauing b&eacute;ene first brewed and broched
in England, from whence (if we may giue credit to our late Chronographers) as from
a poisoned spring it spred it selfe into Wales. For the first abbeie or frierie that is read
to haue b&eacute;ene erected there, since the dissolution of the noble house of Bangor, which
sauoured not of Romish dregs, was the Twy Gwyn, which was builded in the yeare
1146. Afterwards these vermine swarmed like b&eacute;es, or rather crawled like lice ouer
all the land, and drew in with them their lowsie religion, tempered with I wot not how
manie millians of abhominations; hauing vtterlie forgotten the lesson which Ambrosius
Telesinus had taught them [who writ in the yeare 540, when the right christian faith
(which Joseph of Arimathia taught the Ile of Aualon) reigned in this land, before the
proud and bloodthirstie moonke Augustine infected it with the poison of Romish errors]

<p>This (as not impertinent to the purpose) I haue recorded, partlie to shew the palpable
blindnes of that age wherein king John liued, as also the religion which they reposed in a
rotten rag, est&eacute;eming it as a Scala c&oelig;li or ladder to life; but speciallie inferred to this
end, that we may fetch some light from this cl&eacute;ere candle (though the same s&eacute;eme to be
duskish &amp; dim) whereby we may be lead to conceiue in reason and common sense, that
the interrement of the king was according to the custome then in vse and request, and
therefore by all likelihoods he was buried as the p&eacute;eres and states of the land were woont
to be in those daies, after the maner aboue mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Johns
children.</div>

<p>But to let this passe as a cold discourse of a coffen of bones cottered with clods of
claie; you shall vnderstand that he left behind him posteritie of both sexes. For he had
issue by his wife qu&eacute;ene Isabell two sonnes, Henrie who succ&eacute;eded him in the kingdome,
and Richard; thr&eacute;e daughters, Joane married to Alexander king of Scotland, Isabell
coupled in matrimonie with the emperour Frederike the second, and Elianor whome
William earle of Glocester had to wife. He had also another daughter (as some haue
left in writing) called Elianor.</p>

<p>He was comelie of stature, but of looke and countenance displeasant and angrie, somewhat
cruell of nature, as by the writers of his time he is noted, and not so hardie as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
doubtfull in time of perill and danger. But this s&eacute;emeth to be an enuious report vttered
by those that were giuen to speake no good of him whome they inwardlie hated. Howbeit
some giue this witnesse of him (as the author of the booke of Bernewell abbeie
and other) that he was a great and mightie prince, but yet not verie fortunate, much
like to Marius the noble Romane, tasting of fortune both waies: bountifull and liberall
vnto strangers, but of his owne people (for their dailie treasons practised towards him) a
great oppressour, so that he trusted more to forreners than to them, and therfore in the
end he was of them vtterlie forsaken.</p>

<p>&para; Verilie, whosoeuer shall consider the course of the historie written of this prince,
he shall find, that he hath b&eacute;ene little beholden to the writers of that time in which he
liued: for scarselie can they afoord him a good word, except when the trueth inforceth
them to come out with it as it were against their willes. The occasion whereof (as some
thinke) was, for that he was no great fr&eacute;end to the clergie. And yet vndoubtedlie his
d&eacute;eds shew he bad a zeale to religion, as it was then accompted: for he founded the
abbeie of Beauleau in the new forrest, as it were in recompense of certeine parish-churches,
which to inlarge the same forrest be caused to be throwne downe and ruinated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i>
<i>Polydor.</i> &amp; <i>alij.</i></div>

<p>He builded the monasterie of Farendon, and the abbeie of Hales in Shropshire; he
repaired Godstow where his fathers concubine Rosamund laie interred; he was no small
benefactor to the minster of Lichfield in Staffordshire; to the abbeie of Crokesden in the
same shire, and to the chappell at Knatesburgh in Yorkshire. So that (to say what I
thinke) he was not so void of deuotion towards the church, as diuerse of his enimies haue
reported, who of m&eacute;ere malice conceale all his vertues, and hide none of his vices; but
are plentifull inough in setting foorth the same to the vttermost, and interpret all his
dooings and saiengs to the woorst, as may appeare to those that aduisedlie read the
works of them that write the order of his life, which may s&eacute;eme rather an inuectiue than
a true historie: neuerthelesse, sith we cannot come by the truth of things through the
malice of writers, we must content our selues with this vnfr&eacute;endlie description of his
time. Certeinelie it should s&eacute;eme the man had a princelie heart in him, and wanted nothing
but faithfull subiects to haue assisted him in reuenging such wrongs as were doone
and offered by the French king and others.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the pride and pretended authoritie of the cleargie he could not well abide,
when they went about to wrest out of his hands the prerogatiue of his princelie rule and
gouernement. True it is, that to mainteine his warres which he was forced to take in
hand as well in France as elsewhere, he was constreined to make all the shift he could
deuise to recouer monie and bicause he pinched their pursses, they conceiued no small
hatred against him, which when he perceiued, and wanted peraduenture discretion to
passe it ouer, he discouered now and then in his rage his immoderate displeasure, as
one not able to bridle his affections, a thing verie hard in a stout stomach, and thereby
missed now and then to compasse that which otherwise he might verie well haue brought
to passe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Paris.</i></div>

<p>It is written, that he meant to haue become feudarie (for maintenance sake against his
owne disloiall subiects, and other his aduersaries) vnto Miramumeline the great king of
the Saracens: but for the truth of this report I haue little to saie, and therefore I leaue
the credit thereof to the authors. It is reported likewise, that in time when the realme
stood interdicted, as he was abroad to hunt one day, it chanced that there was a great
stag or hart killed, which when he came to be broken vp, prooued to be verie fat and
thicke of flesh; "Oh (saith he) what a plesant life this d&eacute;ere hath led, and yet in all
his daies he neuer heard masse." To conclude, it may s&eacute;eme, that in some respects he
was not greatlie superstitious, and yet not void of religious zeale towards the maintenance
of the cleargie, as by his bountifull liberalitie bestowed in building of abbeies and churches
(as before y&eacute;e haue hard) it may partlie appeare.</p>
